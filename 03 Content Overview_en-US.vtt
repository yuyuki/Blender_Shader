00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.630
as I mentioned in the introduction video,

1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.760
the course is not directly produced as a full package,

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.590
but rather chapter by chapter.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.550
So by the time you are watching this, not everything listed here might be online yet,

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.830
but let me give you an overview of what will be the content of discourse.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.650
I am structuring the course in a way that should make it

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.000
easy for you to come back and look up specific concepts.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.730
Also,

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.460
I want to encourage you to start making

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.050
your own experiments and the Shader editor right away

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.280
and providing a bunch of visualization files that helped

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.250
to show different concepts in an interactive way.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.420
The format of the content is multiple short videos per chapter that hold a

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.660
lot of condensed information and build on the experience of the ones before.

14
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.200
And these videos are supported by longer, slower workflow demonstrations.

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.920
Taking the time to explain every step of creating complete procedural shakers.

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.060
So you have the quick videos with a lot

17
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.170
of information and then the slower lessons of application.

18
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.160
So let's quickly go over the different chapters in what they focus on.

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.900
In the remaining part of this introduction chapter,

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.910
I want to take the time to introduce you

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.650
to the environment that blender provides for procedural shading,

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.590
talking about the render engines,

23
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.940
even cycles and how to use the shader editor if you are already familiar with that,

24
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.160
feel free to skip this section and go on to the first actual chapter where

25
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.370
we are going to talk about the fundamentals

26
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.560
of procedural shade of creation and blender.

27
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.760
That chapter is very crucial as all the other parts build up on it.

28
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.870
Next we will transition into creating actual textures just

29
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.960
using notes and how to combine and manipulate them.

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.540
And the chapter about shading principles.

31
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.510
I'm going to talk more broadly about physically based rendering and how

32
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.660
to approach this specifically in the Shader editor with procedural methods.

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.350
The chapter shader composition will string together the

34
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.480
previous lessons and go deeper into how to

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.680
compose full procedural shakers and also how to

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.780
include non procedural elements in modular setups.

37
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.190
I will show you how to set up parts of the Shader for reuse

38
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.530
as note groups and how to choose

39
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.350
and implement sensible parameters to control their functionality

40
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.020
in automation.

41
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.690
You will see how to make sure there's come alive

42
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.760
by animation and interaction with other elements in the scene

43
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.840
and as final part of the regular content of this course,

44
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.980
I will show you how to break the direct procedural set up by baking elements of

45
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.910
the no trees to make the shader is

46
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.270
more performant and compatible with other software.

47
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.540
Additionally to these main chapters,

48
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.160
there are some other topics that will be interesting to explore

49
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.760
but are rather advanced and did not initially fit into the format of this course.

50
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.850
The topics that I have in mind are a look at

51
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.360
the mathematical background of the methods we use in this course.

52
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.260
A focus on achieving realism. Using procedural methods.

53
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.960
Using back to displacement to create anything with a shader

54
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.860
and different applications of using ray marching.

55
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.120
These are not certainly planned, but rather optional.

56
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.210
So if one of these topics really piques your interest,

57
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.160
or if there is something else you really want to know about,

58
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.650
but don't see in the overview,

59
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.960
let me know with a comment on this video.
