Hey there.

1
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.950
This work for example, we're going to take a look at how this what shade works.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.430
It's still quite a simple shader but it already includes

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.560
a bunch of the things from chapters 12 and three.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.770
So it's a very nice shader to take a look at

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.150
here and there's a bunch of unique things about it.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.950
The main thing is that

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.460
I'll just duplicate this

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.150
one more here.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.360
You can see that when I

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.560
just turn off the scene lights and seen where to go into the material preview.

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.450
You can see that it's actually following

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.660
the rings of a tree.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.160
And if you change the actual geometry,

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.650
you can see

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.360
That the texture itself stays in three d. space.

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.560
So you can just

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.160
do any modeling work.

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.260
The texture is still in place.

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.349
Okay, so let's go into local view

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960
delete this shader in here

21
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.950
And create a new one. For a fresh start.

22
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260
We're going to keep this principle BSD are from the side for now.

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.950
And start by taking a look at what coordinate space we want to use.

24
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.530
If you think back to the video about coordinate space,

25
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.590
you might already know that what we want to use here is the object coordinate space.

26
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.960
I just adding the texture coordinate node

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
and take a look at this so you can see

28
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.690
that the texture space sticks to the objects rotation,

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.850
location and scale.

30
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.970
But if I change anything

31
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.060
from

32
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.490
with an added mode,

33
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.460
it's still locked to the objects location,

34
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.160
which is exactly what we want for the rings to be fixed.

35
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.560
So, let's start out by using these object coordinates

36
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.850
to create the basic ring texture

37
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.360
which is what the whole shed is based on.

38
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.310
And already while I'm working you can see that. I try to keep the layout clean.

39
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.560
So this note with a lot of outputs where I only need one.

40
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.750
I just collapsed the note by pressing control age

41
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
so it only shows the object space which is what I need.

42
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.460
That makes the whole no gravel little bit less cluttered.

43
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.660
Okay first we have to decide what orientation these rings are supposed to have.

44
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.860
Let's take a look at this object uh reset the rotation.

45
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.460
So it's actually oriented in the

46
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.160
world space as well.

47
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.920
And you can see that this is the X coordinate

48
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.760
and this is the Y. Direction.

49
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.670
So what I will be going for is orienting the rings so their axis is along the X. Axis.

50
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.160
And then the rings are created in this orientation.

51
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.410
And what I do to achieve that is just creating a separate X. Y. Z.

52
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.450
Note to split the space into the three components

53
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.450
and then I put it back together.

54
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490
But I only use two of these components

55
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.660
which means that

56
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.750
the third component doesn't play any role anymore. Which is what I want because the

57
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.260
X coordinate

58
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.890
should not have any impact on the texture because it's

59
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.460
going to be the same along the whole axis.

60
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.780
So if I just

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.450
ignore the X. Component take the

62
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.460
why and the zet component here

63
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.160
which are going to be the new accident Y component of this coordinate here.

64
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.860
You can see

65
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.050
that I have a nice texture map which is X and Y

66
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.550
at the orientation of this profile

67
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.900
and it does not change along the whole axis.

68
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.750
I'll just create a new frame here.

69
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.750
Call in

70
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.950
coordinates so we later know what this is.

71
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.550
Mhm

72
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.149
And then let's start getting those rings.

73
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.360
I just create a vector math node

74
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.060
and set it to length

75
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.350
to get the radius

76
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.950
from the X axis. And you can already see how this is going to turn out

77
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.160
and think about this is

78
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.460
if I did not have these notes here,

79
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.360
just mute them.

80
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.590
You can see that it looks a whole lot different

81
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.960
because now the X component plays a role as well

82
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.850
into the length that I have here

83
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.560
And so I have like a spherical

84
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.460
gradients here

85
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.260
but I do not want to sphere, I do want a cylinder

86
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.680
and to do to do that.

87
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.560
I just have to eliminate the X component which is exactly what I did here.

88
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.100
And as you can see,

89
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.110
I get this nice cylindrical

90
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.550
gradient here

91
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.230
and how to turn this

92
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.650
gradient into rings.

93
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.560
I can just do the old trick with repetition

94
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.060
by adding a couple of math nodes where I set the first one to multiply

95
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.760
to just increase

96
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.480
how quickly this

97
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.500
gradient rises.

98
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.960
You can adjust that later still

99
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.160
and another math known

100
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.160
which I said to fraction.

101
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.650
And then you can see I already have this repetition

102
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.460
and I can just scale it

103
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.860
with the multiplication factor.

104
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.360
And this is basically going to be

105
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.650
the input for the amount of rings

106
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.700
that are created.

107
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.650
So

108
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.050
I just choose something and call this note here

109
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.060
brings.

110
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.060
It was just just an arbitrary number for the amount of rings that we get.

111
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.850
Mm.

112
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.730
So right now

113
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.950
this is a very sharp gradient which starts over again.

114
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.360
That is due to the fraction here.

115
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.830
And I want something a little bit smoother.

116
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.850
So instead of fraction I choose ping pong.

117
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.650
But I want to set this factor to one again.

118
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.960
So I get

119
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.450
a value of one at the maximum

120
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.560
of these rings

121
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.660
and this looks a little bit nicer already.

122
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.860
Let's frame these also

123
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.800
quite rings.

124
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.760
And yeah, that's basically already the first step

125
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.350
to creating the texture of this

126
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.560
shader.

127
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.060
And now the next thing I want to do is create some variation in the pattern.

128
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.250
Because right now these rings are completely straight And these variations in

129
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.660
the texture itself only come through the changes in the geometry.

130
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.160
And what I do to get some variation

131
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.550
is thumping around with the coordinates that I use for the whole texture.

132
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.050
And just to get some nice distortion and the pattern.

133
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.060
What I do is adding

134
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.560
a noise texture

135
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.560
and warping the coronets with this texture

136
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.760
and the easiest way to do that is using a color. Mixed note is set to linear light.

137
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.450
So if I just have the linear light here,

138
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.410
the values don't shift overall.

139
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.960
If I were to simply add these values,

140
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.350
the overall value to it shift as well as you can see here

141
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.060
and something you can see here

142
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.840
is that there's noise texture is weirdly stretched.

143
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.570
That's because we haven't given it any specific coordinates yet.

144
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.150
Right now it's just using the generated coordinates.

145
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.260
So instead let me just grab the objects coordinates again.

146
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.560
I just copy this. Not over

147
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.660
so that we have nice separate strings of notes.

148
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.250
And now it's not stretched anymore.

149
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.260
I'll just change a little bit of there's a nice texture

150
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.960
to be more fitting with the rest of the texture,

151
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.659
add a little bit of distortion into this texture as well.

152
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:34.720
And

153
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.360
now it's time to take a look at the resulting texture here

154
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.159
and this is obviously way too much.

155
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.560
So

156
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.350
instead of variation, we get a completely new pattern.

157
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.260
So what we have to do is dialed the linear light factor way down.

158
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.760
And as you can see

159
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.560
If we just give it a little bit of a factor of like 0.03.

160
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.960
It looks much nicer and it gives it a little bit of variation.

161
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.860
Just just the right amount to make the texture look more appealing.

162
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.060
Mhm.

163
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.860
So let's grab these nodes again,

164
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.360
give them a frame

165
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.560
and name the frame. So we know what it is. Later on

166
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.070
next you want to give these rings some variation but

167
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.290
not in the pattern itself but in the values.

168
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.160
Because right now all of the

169
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.660
lower parts of these grooves

170
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.960
are

171
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.640
Exactly zero

172
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.660
and the highest points are all exactly one.

173
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.580
Which later on when we want to use this texture

174
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.060
here to create color or bump map or whatever map

175
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.560
we want to have some variation.

176
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.660
So

177
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.350
to do that I just add in another noise texture

178
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.460
which is going to be responsible for the value control of this texture.

179
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.350
And here as well. I'm going to take the same object coordinates.

180
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.560
I just copy over the note. In fact.

181
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.060
And now I have to combine this

182
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.560
with the ring texture.

183
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.060
And I used for this here a map range noon

184
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.950
because the effect that I want to create is creating variation in the black lines.

185
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.950
So in the darkest points of the grooves

186
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.560
I want the variation but at the top I don't want any variation at all.

187
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.640
So we have the same maximum everywhere

188
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.960
which is exactly one.

189
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.060
But then variation in the lower part

190
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.960
and what I do for that

191
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:52.060
it's just grabbing the ring texture and the noise texture I put into the two men input

192
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.440
which is responsible for the values

193
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.160
that the lowest part of the map is mapped to.

194
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.760
And as you can see

195
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.660
it gives us exactly what I described earlier.

196
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.400
The highest points

197
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.450
are not influenced by this

198
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.660
mapping,

199
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.650
but the darkest points are all mapped to this noise texture here.

200
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.060
But I do want to have some more control over how this variation is supposed to look.

201
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.160
So I want to create some

202
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.460
more control over this noise texture with a color ramp.

203
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.650
I just said it to beast. Plan to get a little bit more of a smooth result

204
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.950
and then play around with the distribution of these stops

205
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.460
to see

206
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.550
when I get a pattern that I like.

207
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.460
Which is probably around here.

208
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.360
And now we have some nice variation

209
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.960
where some of these groups just fade out

210
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.760
again,

211
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.270
creating a frame,

212
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.360
naming it

213
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.960
radiation.

214
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.360
And moving on

215
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.060
now we have the main base texture. Pretty much finished.

216
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.650
And we can go ahead and create a color map out of this.

217
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.660
So I just pick a color ramp.

218
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.660
Use the sector

219
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.150
and create some colors.

220
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.590
I'll just go for something like this. But again.

221
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.250
And she's be supplying here to have a smoother result.

222
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.760
And let's just take a look at this.

223
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.850
Okay, This is maybe a little bit too much contrast

224
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.260
and a little bit too much separation.

225
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.460
And this looks a bit better.

226
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.060
Good. We're going to get come back to the color later on.

227
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.650
But I want to already give it a frame

228
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.060
and then what colour

229
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.760
next?

230
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.730
Let's take a look at the normal map. I just take the same texture here.

231
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.160
Plugging into the height of a bump node

232
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.460
and choose this normal.

233
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.660
Let's connect these and first time take a look at the actual shader

234
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.000
and yeah, this looks pretty awful.

235
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.660
But the main reason is that this bump note is way too cranked up

236
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.750
So let's go away lower to 0.01.

237
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.250
And this looks better.

238
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.650
But the profile of these grooves is way off.

239
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.660
It's just linear in both directions.

240
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.190
So to get more of a smooth curve on the top,

241
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.380
we can simply use RgB curves to control the profile of the height.

242
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.460
So right now

243
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.860
the profile is exactly this linear and then it goes down again

244
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.550
but we can control both sides at the same time

245
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.160
by just using this curve.

246
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:56.650
And what I try to do now is just get the slope of this curve about zero at the top.

247
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.450
So we have a smooth curve here.

248
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.960
And now the fact that the value

249
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.160
Off the top of this group is is still always one

250
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.850
really plays into our hands because now we know that

251
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.560
the value is always going to be mapped here.

252
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.450
If it were to change along the texture

253
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.250
that it might come out like here or somewhere else on this curve

254
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.360
and the slope would not be

255
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.860
zero anymore.

256
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.960
Then the smoothness would break

257
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.170
and it wouldn't work anymore.

258
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.350
So it's nice to still have the maximum at one at all times.

259
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.960
That's again give this a frame, call it normals

260
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.950
and move on to the next PBR map which is the roughness

261
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.830
for the roughness I'm

262
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.860
for now just going to use the same base texture

263
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.150
mm

264
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.460
and add in a color ramp.

265
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.060
Let's just plug it in here

266
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.460
and play around with the values.

267
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.650
What I want to do is flip this around

268
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.550
so we have more

269
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.160
glossy nous at the top

270
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.560
but this is obviously way too much.

271
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.760
So let's style that a little bit

272
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.050
higher.

273
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.350
Get some more roughness in here.

274
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.660
You can obviously still do adjustments when you're creating the shade of yourself.

275
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.840
So this is the basis of the whole shader finished.

276
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.760
Now I want to do some more variations and tricks.

277
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.060
The first thing for that I want to do is create a gradient

278
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.960
along this beam of wood

279
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.360
going from the center outwards

280
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.760
to create some variation in the color.

281
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.350
And to do that. I start out with

282
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.450
the texture coordinates

283
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.960
which I'm going to use the generated ones for now

284
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.260
because I want this shaded to be dynamic

285
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.850
and adjust to the object itself. So when I

286
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.360
changed the geometry

287
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.660
of this

288
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.760
piece of wood to more of a

289
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.060
more the shape of a beam for example,

290
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.660
I wanted still to be

291
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.260
working the same way with the gradient

292
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.580
and the generated corners,

293
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.270
give me exactly that they always adjust to the bounding box of the object.

294
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.770
They go from 0 to 1 on each axis.

295
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.150
So it's collapsed this again

296
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.660
and then create the gradient from this.

297
00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.850
I just separate the components

298
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.190
and as you can see, I already got the right one.

299
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.460
I want to use the X component to create my gradient along this direction.

300
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.560
And where do to just

301
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.170
center and mirror of this gradient

302
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.859
is using a couple of math nodes.

303
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.760
First subtracting 0.5 to center the gradient

304
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.460
around zero.

305
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.760
Then I use the absolute

306
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.950
operation

307
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.560
To mirror the gradient around zero

308
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.170
than a multiplication

309
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.060
by two

310
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.170
To make sure that the edges are at the value of one again.

311
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.870
And

312
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.950
that is mostly now I can just add a color ramp,

313
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.060
two

314
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.460
adjust the exact profile of this gradient.

315
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.360
There's a nice string of operations

316
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.550
to create

317
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.660
centered and mirrored gradients from a coronary vector

318
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.060
that's just frame and name this again.

319
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.560
And let's now use it on the column map.

320
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.670
I just add a name

321
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.660
to be known.

322
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.890
Let's take a look at the result here and

323
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.850
and for the blending mode. I choose overlay.

324
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.170
Just to give some simple color variation

325
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.270
and now you can just

326
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.560
adjust however you want the

327
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.260
factor here.

328
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.060
So we have some

329
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.350
brighter areas outwards and a darker center

330
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.170
Just set this to 0.4

331
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.270
and this gives just some nice variation too.

332
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.550
Change the look of the whole shader a little bit.

333
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.560
Another thing to change the look of the colors

334
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.770
but I want to do is give the edges some emphasis

335
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.810
on this scene is

336
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.660
set up for cycles in general. So what I'm going to use is the point in this

337
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.280
from the geometry known,

338
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.770
which is only available in cycles at the moment.

339
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.460
I just

340
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.670
selected and hide the rest.

341
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.560
No, you can't see anything because we're in E V.

342
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.050
The amount. So let's just swap this to rendered

343
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.860
which is set up for the cycles engine right now

344
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.960
and you still can't see a lot. And the reason for that is the point in itself.

345
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.460
It's quite low contrast till let's just add in a map range. Note

346
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.250
to be able to change

347
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.460
the mapping of this.

348
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.850
I'm just going to increase the minimum

349
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.660
and you can already see what this does.

350
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.670
Let's decrease the maximum

351
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.770
and this looks about what we need.

352
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.550
So it's just grab these

353
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.960
another mixer to be known

354
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.770
to this string of color operations

355
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.460
and then

356
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.360
put this on top.

357
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.170
Well this I don't want to use overlay because they don't want to darken

358
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.200
the faces in any way because of the point of this.

359
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.670
I only want to add some lighting on the edges.

360
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.670
So what I'm going to use here is just the color dodge.

361
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.270
As you can see. This gives some quite subtle

362
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.770
emphasis on the edges here,

363
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.670
which is only going to be visible in cycles rendered view.

364
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.760
But with that set up,

365
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.050
let's go back into the material preview because there are

366
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.670
still a couple of things that I want to do

367
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.010
first.

368
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:55.800
Again,

369
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.270
I just framed this

370
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.460
and the next thing I want to do is

371
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.060
at a gradient of dirt

372
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.240
that is dynamic and depending on the height,

373
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.260
so there is a gradient of dirt from the ground up

374
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.950
and what I do for that is just using a

375
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.860
simple,

376
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.670
diffuse shader

377
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.560
and mixing it together

378
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.670
with the wood shed. Er

379
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.960
I just

380
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.260
turn this into a dirty color

381
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.680
and for now I put the factor to zero because I don't want an overall dirt,

382
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.170
I just want the map from the ground up

383
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.850
and to get that. I use again some texture coordinates first

384
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.170
but this time I'm not going to use any of these

385
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.830
on the texture coordinate note because I want the gradient to be

386
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.970
because I want the gradient to be fixed in the world coordinates.

387
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.960
So instead,

388
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.050
what I use is the geometry note again

389
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.550
and the position coordinates here,

390
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.950
let's collapse this note again

391
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.850
and separate these components

392
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.660
To choose the correct one. So I want the grading to go upwards from the ground

393
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:21.260
and to get that, I choose the zet component and now you can see

394
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.270
that from the height zero on where the three cursor is placed right now

395
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.850
the gradient goes upwards.

396
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.050
So if I just place

397
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.960
this beam

398
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.720
on the ground,

399
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.560
let's just add in a plane. So we see what we do.

400
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.670
You can see that as the gradient going up

401
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.060
and

402
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.560
wherever I position this beam

403
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.960
by sinking into the ground or pull it upwards.

404
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.170
The position of the gradient stays the same

405
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.130
and that's going to be crucial to have this effect depending on the ground level

406
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.460
to adjust

407
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.980
the gradient. I just choose another

408
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.170
my brains known

409
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:02.960
and

410
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.260
if the ground was a little bit lower now

411
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.110
I could just simply adjust this year in the map range. Note

412
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.670
by choosing the from men

413
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.060
as this new position of the ground

414
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:24.670
and then you can select the height of this gradient by just choosing the from max.

415
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.360
Another thing that we can already adjust here is I don't

416
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.670
want the dirt texture to be 100% opaque on top of the

417
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.060
wood texture

418
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.770
so you can just set the maximum

419
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.350
of its capacity

420
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.780
By changing the two max

421
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:42.960
value.

422
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.850
So I just select 0.8.

423
00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.950
If I just plug this in here

424
00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.850
you can see there's probably the opposite way around.

425
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.900
It is but that doesn't matter. We can just change these values around here.

426
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.760
Select .8 for the minimum

427
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.060
and zero for the maximum

428
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.770
and there we go.

429
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.270
Now there's a subtle gradient from the bottom up which is just

430
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.560
to the height of the object itself

431
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.670
and that's the shader. Almost done. There's one last thing I want to do

432
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.460
after

433
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.350
framing these

434
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.550
and that last thing

435
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.530
comes into play when I have multiple objects because I just

436
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.350
duplicate this beam. You can see

437
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.460
it has the exact same pattern

438
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.000
and there's really no reason to have the same texture because it's all procedural.

439
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:36.850
So

440
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.860
there's no problem with having the same image texture all the time.

441
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.960
And to change this

442
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.450
we can simply use the

443
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.270
object in florida

444
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.560
which has the capability of giving us a random value per object.

445
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.360
And we can use that to change around this pattern.

446
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.270
The easiest thing to do this now is to change the noise texture.

447
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:03.940
Yeah

448
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.770
into 40.

449
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.560
It gives us an additional dimension

450
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.360
that influences this pattern.

451
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.760
And if I just

452
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.170
plug in the random value to the w input of this

453
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.670
for a dimensional noise texture. Now

454
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.680
you can see

455
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.770
that the random value influences

456
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.960
the pattern as well.

457
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.690
But right now they're all very similar.

458
00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.660
Still you can see that some of them are really similar

459
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.460
others less.

460
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.360
But the reason for that is that this noise texture is still smooth along this axis

461
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.060
and the scale is quite low.

462
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.670
Then

463
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.490
a smaller change in this dimension

464
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.960
does not make much of a difference in the pattern.

465
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.060
So what I want to do to counter that is adding another math note.

466
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.170
And setting it to multiply

467
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.080
That way we can change the range of this

468
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.770
random value which is itself between zero and 1

469
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.420
Do we between zero and

470
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.950
100 for example.

471
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.590
And

472
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.350
then these changes

473
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.560
make a lot more of a difference.

474
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.190
Now these patterns are still a little bit similar and the reason

475
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.460
for that is just that the geometry is the exact same.

476
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.550
So if you still want to adjust how it looks,

477
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.060
the best way would probably be to just

478
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.550
there is change the position of the origin.

479
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.550
That way you can directly control the texture space

480
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.960
because it's taking the object cornice

481
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.770
and this way you get some more subtle variations as well.

482
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.770
But yeah at this point this traitor is done and

483
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.320
I was interesting. I hope you learned something and it supported the course itself.

484
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.060
One last thing for me to do frame these two nodes

485
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.960
and call them

486
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.360
random.
