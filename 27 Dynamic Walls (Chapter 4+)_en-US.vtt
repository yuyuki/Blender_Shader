Hello and welcome to the next work, for example,

1
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.700
for the procedural shading course in this work for example,

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.290
we're going to take a look at how to create this advanced wall shader that is

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.210
building up from the wall share that we've done in the first work for example,

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.050
and adds the functionality too,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
scratch off the plaster for a hidden underlying wooden structure

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.980
that can be dynamically removed with using the vertex colors.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.860
And this is the no tree. I know it looks quite scary at the first sight, but

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.160
we're going to break it down step by step

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.360
and we're not going to completely start from scratch because we already have the

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960
plaster material which is this part of the no tree.

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.130
That is what we did in the first work for example.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.260
So we're going to build up from that and

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.460
what's left to create is the

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360
pattern of the wooden structure underneath

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.550
and then also the mask to blend between them.

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.959
I showed this material as well in the video about blending and masking

17
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.080
and yeah, in this video we're going to build it from the ground up.

18
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.070
This is probably going to be a long one. I'm going to go into detail of every step.

19
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.450
And uh yeah, so let's get started.

20
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.580
Alright, so to increase the general performance,

21
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.960
I'm going to go into the isolated local view

22
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.260
for only this wall object that's already running a lot smoother.

23
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.460
Um but yeah,

24
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.860
first we have to get rid of this material and start with a completely new one.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.910
And first let's start with generating the

26
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.740
pattern for the underlying wooden structure.

27
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.060
Now this material is interesting because it includes a bunch

28
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.120
of techniques that we haven't taken a look at it.

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.810
The previous work for examples and it builds on a couple of things that I've

30
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
talked about in the video series but I haven't used for the other work for examples

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.280
for example how to create more advanced patterns,

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.150
which is what we are going to start with now

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370
because first for the one structure,

34
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.160
you want some horizontal bars and for this I'm going to use the

35
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.860
position

36
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.860
coordinates

37
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.620
to detach the structure from the object itself but fix

38
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.850
it in place and what I want from these position coordinates

39
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.950
is the zet component

40
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.550
because the horizontal bars are going to be along this axis.

41
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.260
Let's collapse this node.

42
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.560
And so I add and

43
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.360
a multiply known to scale

44
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.560
the component up.

45
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.090
And actually I'm going to add in

46
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.460
a value input node to control the scale value

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.960
and now I want to repeat these coordinates

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.050
by

49
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.960
adding in another math node

50
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.050
and I said it to the ping pong operation

51
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.360
as you have seen me doing before

52
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.660
and when I set the scale to one and make sure that these

53
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.460
black lines are exactly zero and the white lines are exactly at one.

54
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.060
So I can fix the minimum maximum values

55
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.260
and now there's value, input node controls basically the frequency of these bars

56
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.850
and now we have the base texture for these bars already done

57
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.750
What I want to do to add some more control

58
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.060
is getting a Rgb curves known

59
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.460
and now I can exactly control the profile of these bars.

60
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.550
Let me do something like this.

61
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.560
You can still change that later on.

62
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.450
And this is the black parts are going to be the gap between the bars

63
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.260
and the white parts are going to be the

64
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.550
bars and I already included some roundness to the edge

65
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.260
which we're going to use later for the height map.

66
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.960
Let's move this out of the way for now

67
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.160
and

68
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.460
also add some vertical bars.

69
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.590
Now this is going to work in a similar way

70
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.460
but now I don't want to use the position coordinates

71
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.150
because that's not going to work for the other direction

72
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.040
because if you think about it,

73
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.459
I will have walls that are placed perpendicular to this one.

74
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.550
And if I would just take the Y component of the world coordinates

75
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.560
to get the component along this axis,

76
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.560
it would not work the same way for a

77
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.560
while that is repeated around his axis.

78
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.810
So instead I have to use coordinates that are stuck

79
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.170
to the surface for a rotation along these access.

80
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.550
And I'm going to use generated coordinates for that.

81
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.310
So that's adding another separate exposition on and

82
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.750
here because it's a different coordinate space.

83
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.860
I'm going to just use the X coordinates.

84
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.550
Mhm.

85
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.360
It's collapsed these again.

86
00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.360
And then I do the exact same thing as with the horizontal bars I multiply

87
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.760
and use ping pong.

88
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.560
uh this value note again, let's go for 15

89
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.560
And the Ping Pong to one.

90
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.650
Because what I want is to have

91
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.420
vertical bars that are much more spars and

92
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.280
have larger gaps than the horizontal bars.

93
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.460
And now that's adding a map range known.

94
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.450
And with that map range note, now

95
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.360
we can change

96
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.150
where these bars actually are.

97
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.360
The bars are going to be placed very thin along one of these axes.

98
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.310
And for that,

99
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.310
I don't want to use the exact same technique I've been using

100
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.560
with this RgB curve to control the gaps by just moving them directly

101
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.760
because that would mean that the profile would end up very

102
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.700
squished on the side

103
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.350
and the control would be worse.

104
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.760
So instead

105
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.860
I'm going to first use a map range note. And for that define the range

106
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.350
as something else. For example, here I'm going to take

107
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.160
.2 and .1

108
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.310
as the inputs.

109
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.060
And that way I can nicely select the outer and inner edge of the profile.

110
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.780
And because I'm clamping the value here,

111
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.090
this whole area is exactly zero and the

112
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.960
area inside without the transition is exactly one.

113
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.860
And now still I can control the profile of this transition with an Rgb curve

114
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.650
and now I can make it more like this

115
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.860
and this is pretty much the same technique as here.

116
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.560
But now I have a more convenient way of controlling the transition range

117
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.660
and now we have the vertical bars taken care of as well

118
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.560
as you can see they are approximately the same with but

119
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.870
one has much larger gaps between them.

120
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.250
Next let's just take care of the third and final element that we have in the

121
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.460
wooden structure, which are the bolts

122
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.750
that said exactly at the cross section of those bars.

123
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.410
And because of the fact that they are supposed

124
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.550
to exactly use those positions of the cross sections,

125
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.130
I can actually take the coordinates directly

126
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.150
from both those horizontal and vertical bars.

127
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.460
So for the bolts, I'm going to build a new coordinate system

128
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.100
based on

129
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.550
the coordinates I have

130
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.870
by using a combined X Y Z node.

131
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.660
And now let's see what do we need.

132
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.950
I'm going to just take the scaled up coordinates and

133
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.750
let's see this one is going to be my Y coordinate

134
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.090
And

135
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.760
this scaled up, one is going to be my x coordinate

136
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.450
long this direction.

137
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.060
So for now let's just plug those in here.

138
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.960
And that's actually swapped these around. So it is a little bit more readable.

139
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.060
And let's take a look.

140
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.760
Okay, so these are going to be the coordinates for my bolts.

141
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.360
Let's use a vector math operation

142
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.660
because what I want to do is create cells

143
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.650
where each cell contains a bolt

144
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.460
and taking a look at these patterns. That means the

145
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.550
the edges of these cells

146
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.559
have to be exactly

147
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.159
in the center of these black areas here. And if I just use the stretched coordinates

148
00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.950
that I have here now,

149
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.160
I can simply use the fraction operation

150
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.460
mhm

151
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.150
to get exactly those smaller cell departments for the bolts.

152
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.370
But this is getting a little bit difficult

153
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.390
to handle because you don't really see what we

154
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.360
are doing and what I want to do to help with that is at a math known

155
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.450
and combine these two height maps

156
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.960
with the maximum operation.

157
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.170
So you can actually see what the whole pattern is going to look like.

158
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.350
And now we can see where the bolts are going to sit

159
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.390
which is exactly here.

160
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.450
And these are supposed to be the centers of the cells that we need here.

161
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.360
Let's take a look.

162
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.620
And as you can see that's

163
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.060
not the case

164
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.360
right now they're on the edges of where we need them.

165
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.760
And also they are not the right size.

166
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.040
And the reason for that is that the ping pong operation

167
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.460
that we're using to create the bars goes from 0 to 1

168
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.750
And then back to zero again.

169
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:59.060
But the length between these edges here is exactly two and not one.

170
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.950
But what the fraction operation does

171
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.850
Is only go from 0 to 1

172
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.150
And then again from 0 to 1.

173
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.560
So the length of these cells is half the size

174
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.460
of the length between these edges here, which is exactly what you can see here.

175
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.560
So we have to do to counter this is adding another math note here,

176
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.660
That divides by two

177
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.460
to stretch the whole thing out

178
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.860
and with the same thing

179
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.350
and do the same thing for the other component.

180
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.750
Now the cells are the right size as you can see here

181
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.190
but they are still not the correct spot.

182
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.170
They need to be shifted

183
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.160
in the

184
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.650
X direction.

185
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.850
So the positions of the bolts are actually in the center of these cells.

186
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.660
And to do that, you can simply after this divide operation, add in a

187
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.160
subtract operation.

188
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.660
And by subtracting 0.5,

189
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.460
the fraction operation is going to exactly be shifted by half

190
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.660
as you can see here.

191
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.950
If I subtract zero,

192
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.450
it is the same as if I subtracted one

193
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.150
Because the fraction Operation Wraps around at one.

194
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.160
If I go to 0.5 it's going to be exactly shifted by half

195
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.420
which is

196
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.640
exactly what I need.

197
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.660
And now

198
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.860
if we take a look at these,

199
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.900
you can see that the centers of these cross sections

200
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.160
are all exactly in the center of these cells.

201
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.950
So now you've already taken care of the correct positioning of the bolts

202
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.550
and we only have to create the balls themselves.

203
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.460
You can simply do that by subtracting

204
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.050
A vector of 0.5

205
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.420
and both wine

206
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.760
X axis

207
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.460
to center the coordinate system

208
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.260
that we get from this

209
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.550
exactly in each cell.

210
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.950
And now we can

211
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.760
use another vector math notes, set to length

212
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.260
to get the radius in there.

213
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.660
And here we can see that these are not exactly circles.

214
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.280
These shapes are more elliptical and the reason for that is that it is stretched.

215
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.160
You can simply counter that by

216
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.920
multiplying

217
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.860
with a vector that you have to

218
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.150
choose depending on the geometry.

219
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.160
Let's just call for something

220
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.160
like this. We can still take a look at what it looks like

221
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.140
and right now we still have this gradient which we are going to use later,

222
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.450
but for now I want to see what the ball is going to look like

223
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:53.050
and for that I'm going to convert it into an actual bullion mosque by simply using the

224
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.760
less than operation.

225
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.530
We can choose the radius of the balls and you

226
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.860
can see that it is still a little bit stretched.

227
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.160
Let's go for something like four

228
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.550
and now it looks much more circular.

229
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.060
And now to take another look at

230
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.050
how this looks like in the whole picture.

231
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.760
Let's just

232
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.950
subtract the mask of the bolts that we have generated from the mosque of the bars

233
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.340
and here we go,

234
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.550
you can see that the bulls are in exactly the right

235
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.350
place so we can move on to the next part.

236
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.890
Let me just slim down this preview. So we have more space to work with.

237
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.030
It's already getting a little bit crowded here.

238
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.460
These notes here by the way are just for preview so we can see what we are doing.

239
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.860
So let's go ahead and start mixing the PBR maps from these base textures.

240
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.360
What I want is a mask of where the wood and the bolts are going to be

241
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.660
for the balls. I already have exactly that with this less than known.

242
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.560
But for the would I have to still

243
00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.960
generate something

244
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.060
and for that I'm going to use the greater than node

245
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.040
Set it to

246
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.460
greater than zero.

247
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.250
And just

248
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.350
for the horizontal bars, use this uh part of the RGB curves note

249
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.100
and for the vertical bars, I'm going to do pretty much the same thing.

250
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.050
But here I'm going to already grab this output because there

251
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.350
it is already scaled to the right range.

252
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.360
I have the individual mosques

253
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.760
for both the boards

254
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.660
and I'm going to combine them with another maximum note.

255
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.350
This mosque now only contains the

256
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.500
Values of zero and one

257
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.660
where the

258
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.180
wood is going to be

259
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.060
including the bolts right now.

260
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.360
So to mix a color map, we're going to first

261
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.150
makes the background color with the wood colour,

262
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.660
which is just going to be some

263
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.280
brownish color

264
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.860
for the background. I'm just going to choose black for now

265
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.060
And then in a second step, we're going to

266
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.450
mixing the bolts as well

267
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.910
using some

268
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.050
gravestone.

269
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.240
Yeah,

270
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.360
we can still adjust those later

271
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.550
and that is the base pattern. Already taken care of.

272
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.360
And now it's for the first time.

273
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.460
Take a look at the shader

274
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.460
and for now it's nothing too exciting because we only have the color

275
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.860
map mixed and it doesn't contain a lot of information right now,

276
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.460
but I do already want to add in another property of the material which is that the

277
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.960
spaces in between the bars are going to be transparent and

278
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.270
be able to have light shining through them.

279
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.960
So what I do for that is at in a transparent BST afternoon

280
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.820
and

281
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.860
mix it

282
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.210
with the shader

283
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.450
and now I need a mask off these halls

284
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.760
which coincidentally is exactly the same mask as I have for the would initially,

285
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.050
which is exactly this,

286
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.760
this is just the

287
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.730
inverse of a mosque for the holes so I can just use it like that,

288
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.990
I only have to take care of the order of

289
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.060
the shader is that I mixed together

290
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.770
and this already gives me the right result. The problem now just is that

291
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.680
for evey transparency is not enabled for the shader

292
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.960
as you can see in cycles. It already is transparent

293
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.410
but to enable it in even as well you can simply scroll

294
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.270
down in the material settings and set the blend mode to something else

295
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.680
for this shader of a clip will do just

296
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.060
fine because there's no semi transparency going to be involved

297
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.859
so it just selected and as you can see

298
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.550
it works as it should

299
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.410
and while I'm already at it,

300
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.890
I'm going to add another functionality to the shader which is

301
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.170
something similar to back face culling.

302
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.680
I don't want the backside of the shader to be or influencing the rendering at all.

303
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.160
So I'm just going to add another mixture later known.

304
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.820
But what I am going to mix with is just an empty shader which is just going to be black.

305
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.860
And as the factor, I'm going to use the geometry node

306
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.060
and the back facing

307
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.460
input,

308
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.900
which just returns a one when you're looking at the back side of the face.

309
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.950
Now let's get back to the wooden shader itself.

310
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.690
We're going to set it up for the use with cycles and displacement.

311
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.450
So what we need is going to be a height map.

312
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.920
This had map is also going to make it look more interesting and Evie,

313
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:08.080
because we are going to use the displacement also for creating a normal map.

314
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:12.670
But one thing after the other, let's start setting together the height map here.

315
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.560
We already have the profile of these bars

316
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.270
with these curves.

317
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.860
So each one of these maps here is already a height map for the individual elements.

318
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.270
The only problem is that they are set between zero and 1

319
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.590
and for the horizontal Boris

320
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.060
you actually have to also keep in mind

321
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.900
that this graph is going into negative infinity,

322
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.660
practically.

323
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.460
So that is something to keep in mind when putting together the height map.

324
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.770
So first of all, let's select the correct ranges for the values

325
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.370
the easiest way to do that is. Again using a map range known.

326
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.060
So that's just simply

327
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.670
plug these in here.

328
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.560
I'm going to already

329
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.270
the second one.

330
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.130
Let's go somewhere a little bit more space.

331
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:11.510
And now you can simply select the height of the top and the bottom

332
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:16.060
part of the mosque by selecting the two men and two max values.

333
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.380
This is where we are able to control the whole depth profile of the shader.

334
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.170
So you have to be a little bit more careful

335
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.250
when selecting these values because you can

336
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.140
easily get intersections of different elements.

337
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.670
What I'm going to do is place the

338
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.500
vertical bars

339
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.550
directly behind the horizontal bars

340
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.670
and

341
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.350
let's see what we have. These are the vertical bars.

342
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.860
So these are going to be a little bit lower in height.

343
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.860
So let's select the lower end of them as 0.3

344
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.270
And the upper end is 0.4.

345
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.270
Yeah,

346
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.100
Now the horizontal bars are going to be sitting right on top of them.

347
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.550
So they are going to start at 0.4

348
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.460
And then end at 0.5.

349
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.760
Let's combine these two maps by using the maximum node.

350
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.770
So the one on top is actually going to be

351
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.860
used

352
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.060
and now you can see that the vertical bars are gone.

353
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.170
The reason for that is

354
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.060
that the map range known for the horizontal Boris is clamped.

355
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.960
So the minimum value is going to be 0.4 for all of the gaps between the bars.

356
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.350
So here it is actually important

357
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.660
that we have these negative values to be able to include the

358
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.350
to be able to include the vertical bars using the maximum note.

359
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.350
So instead of clamping, I'm just going to leave it as it is.

360
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.170
And here we go,

361
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.550
the vertical bars show up. And additionally

362
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.060
the gaps that were in the negative space

363
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.360
on this note still

364
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.520
Are now on another level,

365
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:07.260
which is 0.3 because of using the maximum operation with this texture.

366
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:08.770
Yeah,

367
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:15.270
So 0.3 is going to be the height that the gaps are going to be at.

368
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.650
And now it's already

369
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.670
Use these four a displacement map to see what we get.

370
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.170
So it's out in a displacement. Known

371
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.350
choose this as the hide map

372
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.560
and plug it into the output.

373
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.850
So right now it is way too high.

374
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.060
Let's go back

375
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.660
quite a bit started to 0.1.

376
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.620
And you can see that the displacement map already

377
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.170
nicely gives us a normal map for these bars

378
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.060
where the profile can still be defined

379
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.590
by these curved notes.

380
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.860
But for now I'm just going to go for something as simple.

381
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.950
There is one thing left to include into the height map,

382
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.310
which are the bolts.

383
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.460
They should also have some detail.

384
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.410
And what I want to do here is have some in Dent,

385
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.460
the height map where the bolts are going to be

386
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.560
to define the height

387
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.670
of these bolts. I'm going to use another map range note.

388
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.160
And now I'm going to use the radio information

389
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.550
from the center to outwards

390
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.590
at the position of the bolts.

391
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.350
Mhm.

392
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.170
Let's just plug that in here.

393
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:32.840
Yeah.

394
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.610
And now we can define the level of the bolts.

395
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.260
I'm going to set the two men and two max temporarily to zero and one

396
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.270
to be able to actually see what I'm doing.

397
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.450
And now

398
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.760
we can select

399
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.760
where the

400
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.950
and then it is going to be.

401
00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.260
And the inner radius here should be exactly the

402
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.850
same radius that we have for the bolts themselves.

403
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.960
So I'm just going to add in a value note to control both at the same time.

404
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.060
This is 0.12. So let's select the same thing

405
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.070
and let's get this done at the

406
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.160
from men.

407
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.460
So when we increase the radius of the bolts,

408
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.660
that's going to affect both the mask

409
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.760
and the height map.

410
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.400
Now we have to choose the from max

411
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.760
as something slightly higher.

412
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.670
And this is going to find the transition

413
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.770
now to be able to still change this radius

414
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.260
without having to manual adapt from max all the time.

415
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.860
I'm just going to use this value again

416
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.670
And at a small value on top like .02,

417
00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.550
let's grab the value

418
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.060
and plug it in there.

419
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.950
Maybe points. They were too a little bit small. Let's take point

420
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.670
0.5.

421
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.570
And now we still have to define the correct

422
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.440
minimum and maximum for the actual height

423
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.460
of this map.

424
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.950
And now we have to think back of the height map that we have here.

425
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.460
So the

426
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.860
place where the bolts are going to set is here

427
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.460
Where the maximum of a hype map is reached at 0.5.

428
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.860
So the maximum of this map here should also be 0.5.

429
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.810
And as the minimum,

430
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.750
I'm going to choose something slightly lower to have some small Indian.

431
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.770
Let's go for 0.48.

432
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.860
And as you can see this is barely even visible anymore

433
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.960
And that's why I still kept it on zero and one to define the

434
00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.060
range.

435
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.670
So we could actually see what we are doing.

436
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.170
Let's combine it into the height map by using this time a minimum

437
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.360
operation

438
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.780
because now we want to lower the height in the correct parts.

439
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.360
So that's

440
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.270
choose the right maps to combine

441
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.560
and you can't really see that it works but it does believe me,

442
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.720
I can prove that by simply plugging the new height

443
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.460
map into the height input of the displacement node.

444
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:28.770
Okay.

445
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.550
And if you take a look, you can see that works just as it should

446
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.170
if you want to you can also change the interpolation type to make, it

447
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.270
is smoother transition.

448
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.350
Yeah, that's the basic structure already taken care of

449
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.970
And now that we see what we are doing,

450
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.360
let's just delete these notes that were just for preview.

451
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.160
Next I want to add some more variation and interest to the shader.

452
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.060
So let's first add a little bit of a pattern onto the horizontal bars

453
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.670
which are the main part of the shader itself.

454
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.350
And for that I'm just going to grab the

455
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.550
object coordinates this time

456
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.650
I just want to add a simple stripe pattern.

457
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:21.050
So what I'm going to do is the exact same thing again that I used for the wooden bars.

458
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.960
Just the separate X, Y. Z. You are going to grab the X coordinate

459
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.170
at a multiply

460
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.670
operation

461
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.270
to scale it up

462
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.860
The Ping Pong operation said to a scale of one

463
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.770
to get the pattern.

464
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.170
And let's choose a input value node

465
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.360
At 200 to get a high frequency stripe pattern.

466
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.420
This pattern.

467
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.230
I want to include into the color map of these horizontal

468
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.880
bars to make it look a little bit more interesting.

469
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.550
And the same over the whole bar,

470
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.950
I'm going to just use a map range known

471
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.670
and choose this output from the ping pong note of the horizontal bars as the value.

472
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.340
What that means is that I'm going to

473
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.350
mix

474
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.270
The two men and two max values

475
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.660
along the range of the center and the edge of these bars.

476
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.660
So if I just plug the stripe pattern that I just generated

477
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.270
Into the two max,

478
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.210
it's going to look like this.

479
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.100
And now I can

480
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.590
choose with the two men

481
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.060
where these edges here go.

482
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.160
And if we take a look back

483
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.270
this is the center of the bars.

484
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.350
And now I can select where the edges of the Boris are.

485
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.670
I'm just going decided to one.

486
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.560
So we just get these striped in dense.

487
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.770
I'm also going to set it to smooth step which

488
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.510
makes the whole pattern look a little bit small,

489
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:10.960
smooth.

490
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.550
But right now it is only smooth along this axis.

491
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.550
The stripes themselves have still a hard edge.

492
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.950
And to change that,

493
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.350
you can for example,

494
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.430
just use an RGB curves now to control the whole profile of these tribes

495
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.670
and then you can control how they are actually supposed to look like.

496
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:37.060
And now this map is what I'm going to use to provide the base color map for the wood.

497
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.260
I'm just going to use a color um for this.

498
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.360
Let's take the correct input

499
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.060
and take a look at it,

500
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.060
maybe like this and then plug them into the input for the wooden colour.

501
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.070
And now there's a little bit more interest to the pattern itself.

502
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.140
But for me these stripes are a little bit to synchronous.

503
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.260
So what I want to do is add some randomness

504
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.390
into the mix.

505
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.170
Yeah.

506
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.760
And what I want to do here is at a random angle for each bar

507
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.360
and what we need to be able to do that is

508
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.260
a random value

509
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.270
for each cell

510
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.270
that these bars are in.

511
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.960
So again, I'm just going to use the coordinates that I use for the horizontal bars.

512
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.550
and then I'm going to add a math note

513
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.660
that I said to snap

514
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.910
and the snap operation simply snaps the values

515
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.170
repeatedly in a certain range

516
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.560
where you can choose the increment.

517
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.470
And if you think back to the fact that we

518
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.560
are using a ping pong operation to define the bars,

519
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.560
You can see that again. We have to use an increment of two

520
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.960
because the height of the cells that the bars are in

521
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.430
is to

522
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.060
let's just choose to and as you can see

523
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.360
these increments here have the exact right height

524
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.060
and to generate a random value out of this.

525
00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.460
We can simply use a white noise.

526
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.500
Just change the dimension to one because that is what we have.

527
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.170
We have a simple value map

528
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.160
and now we got random colors for all the individual cells of these wooden bars.

529
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.950
Now you could use those colors to add a variation for example in the color of the bars.

530
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.420
But what I want to do is simply add a variation

531
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.180
in the rotation of this pattern that I just created.

532
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.450
So let's put these random values on the side for now

533
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.800
and

534
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.170
at a

535
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.950
vector. A Take note

536
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.170
to the korean space that we're using to create this pattern.

537
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.460
And if I take a look back at the pattern itself,

538
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.960
you can see that now we can

539
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.350
control the rotation.

540
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.360
We don't need all of these parameters here. I'll simply

541
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.360
Change this to zero taxes

542
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.760
and this angle is now exactly what we are going to randomize.

543
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.980
If I just already take this random value and plug it in.

544
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:25.090
You can see that we already get a nice random rotation And

545
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.360
if you wanted to you could already keep it as this and

546
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.460
use this for the pattern.

547
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.960
But I still want to

548
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.850
map this

549
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.670
random angle into a different range

550
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.270
because the random values that

551
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.290
we have from this white noise texture are

552
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.530
all uniformly distributed between zero and one.

553
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.950
So there are no negative angles

554
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.020
and no angles greater than one.

555
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:56.850
Now

556
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.060
1 here

557
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.750
does not mean one degree because the angle

558
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.860
that this victory take note takes

559
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.330
when you plug something in

560
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.590
is in radiance.

561
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.170
Other than the value that you can select here which is in degrees.

562
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.050
So to get some more intuitive control

563
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.170
you can add a math notes set to

564
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.560
two radiance

565
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.360
and then

566
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.670
or we can choose here is a number of degrees.

567
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:30.850
Mhm.

568
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.460
Now obviously one degree is not that much. So the effect is way tuned down.

569
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:39.660
But now

570
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.860
by adding a

571
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.560
math known set to multiply

572
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.630
we can change the range of these values

573
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.670
instead of having one degree is the maximum

574
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.950
having something else like

575
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.960
60 degree.

576
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.060
But still

577
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.350
we don't have any negative angles.

578
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.270
So I'm also going to add in a subtract note

579
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.770
To subtract 0.5.

580
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.360
I do that before the multiplication. Because that means

581
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.770
if we just take a look at these two knows here.

582
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.050
The values that come out of here are between zero and 1.

583
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:25.250
And when I subtract the values that I get are between negative 0.5 and positive 0.5.

584
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.670
And when I then multiply with 60

585
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.770
Instead of getting values that are between zero and 60

586
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.270
I got values between negative 30 and positive 30.

587
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.510
So subtracting 0.5 simply centers the values around zero.

588
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.040
Now if you want to be able to control a little bit how these patterns look.

589
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.360
You can simply

590
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.690
you can simply add another node

591
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.360
right before

592
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.960
the snap values going to the white noise texture

593
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:56.960
and

594
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.560
add a value on top.

595
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.270
This essentially functions like choosing a seed because different values

596
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.670
give us different results for the random values

597
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.090
that the white noise gives us.

598
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.560
So if you don't like a specific pattern you can just choose something else here.

599
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.850
So let's take a look back

600
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.400
at the shader

601
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.469
we are creating

602
00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:19.750
Mhm.

603
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.060
And this already gives us a little bit of variation

604
00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.960
but this is still the simple material preview with Evie.

605
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.250
We are setting the shader up for cycles with displacement.

606
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.550
So right now displacement is not yet set up correctly.

607
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.080
And the reason why we don't have any displacement here right

608
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.750
now is that it is not enabled in the material settings.

609
00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.969
The displacement that we plug into the material output note

610
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.460
is simply going to be converted as a normal map.

611
00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.260
If you also want displacement, you have to change it to displacement and bump.

612
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.260
And now as you can see this height map is actually generating some

613
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.560
displacement in the geometry

614
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.160
and this is a little bit more going into the direction of what we want to create.

615
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.760
Actually, let's go out of the local view and take a look at the shader

616
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.560
in the scene setup.

617
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.360
These computers obviously struggling, which is understandable.

618
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.970
So let's create a render border.

619
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.670
And as you can see we can actually

620
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.760
the pattern that we were looking for.

621
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.560
The height map works nicely with the indians of the bolts.

622
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.060
We have transparency between the bars and the bars are one in front of the other

623
00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.760
with the horizontal ones on top.

624
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.550
And we also have this very subtle stripe texture

625
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.750
that is randomly oriented.

626
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.850
But I do want to adjust some PBR maps of the principal PSD F

627
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.780
Western. Going to adjust the roughness

628
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.160
and make it higher.

629
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.980
I'm not going to add in a map that is different

630
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.240
across the shader because that is fitting with the general stylist.

631
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.350
Look that I'm going for.

632
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.340
And I also want the bolts to actually be metallic.

633
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.960
So I simply grab the mask of the bolts

634
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.840
and plug it into the metallic input of the

635
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.750
principal be sdf shader.

636
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.750
I do want to add some more variation.

637
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.840
Let's go back into the material preview and local view

638
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.860
to have it a little bit smoother.

639
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.350
And what I want to do is add in a

640
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.350
noise texture to affect the normals

641
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.660
because right now it looks very smooth

642
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.810
And here I'm actually going to use a different technique

643
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.550
that the one I have presented with the bump maps.

644
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.050
I am simply going to take the

645
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.340
normals from the geometry node

646
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.850
and then manipulate those

647
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.660
because the thing with the bump map is that it is not that easy to process

648
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.740
and simply

649
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.820
manipulating the normals directly is a little

650
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.750
bit easier on the computer and there's no

651
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.150
real need to need to use a bump map to just add some noise.

652
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.650
So what I do is just

653
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.190
create a noise texture. I'm going to use the position coordinates for this one.

654
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.050
So I'm just going to copy this geometry node and use the position coordinates.

655
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.240
And

656
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.960
now I'm going to take the

657
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.340
normals

658
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.960
and manipulate them with

659
00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.350
makes RGb known

660
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.530
by plugging them in like this and using the linear light operation,

661
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.750
this very easily distorts the normals

662
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.830
without having to use a bump note.

663
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.260
And if we just

664
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.150
plug this into the normals,

665
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.150
you can see the effect of having some added noise.

666
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.440
Now this is not something I would recommend if you want

667
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.720
to go for pure realism but just to add some variation.

668
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.740
This is a nice and easy technique

669
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.650
and yeah, there's this

670
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.250
the first part of the shader done. We are

671
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.250
where we are creating the

672
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.540
wooden structure

673
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.240
for underneath the plaster.

674
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.970
Let's take a look how it looks

675
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.030
and as you can see now we have some nice variation in the surface.

676
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.680
Okay, so now that this part of the shader is done,

677
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.830
let's go ahead and take on the mask in

678
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.750
between the plaster and the wooden structure underneath.

679
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.150
For that.

680
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.040
I'm just going to copy over the notes set up that we already made for the wall

681
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.910
which is this.

682
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.150
I'm just going to do that by

683
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.530
copying with control C.

684
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.840
And paste them with control V.

685
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.950
And that works nicely here.

686
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.040
And I also gave the network for the wooden structure an additional frame

687
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.950
so we know what it is later on.

688
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.330
Okay, so for this part now

689
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.160
I want to set up the shader in a way that it is controllable with vertex colors.

690
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.570
I talked about that in the chapter about blending and masking.

691
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.530
I also already told you a little bit how to work with that

692
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.740
but here I want to go over it in a little bit more detail

693
00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.180
and show you the individual steps so to be able to work with the vertex colors,

694
00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.760
we first have to advertise, correlate to the object.

695
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.240
You can just do that in the

696
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.820
mesh settings here

697
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.140
and go to various courage

698
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.760
and click on the plus,

699
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.230
you can also turn off the flea just switching to

700
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.110
vertex paint mode and it automatically creates a layer.

701
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.140
Once you start painting

702
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.500
but you can also add multiple layers here and have

703
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.440
them control individual parts of the share for example.

704
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.730
So that's just going to solve you. So we know what we're doing for now

705
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.140
and go into vertex paint mode

706
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:35.940
to adjust these settings. You can go here into the active tool settings

707
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.600
and as you can see we have black as our

708
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.240
foreground color and white as our background call selected.

709
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.030
So once we start drawing is going to be

710
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.640
paint it black

711
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.870
and when you had in control it's using the background colors.

712
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.530
So it's going to be so it's going to be painting in white again.

713
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.970
So this is not running super smoothly.

714
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.610
And the reason for that is the high subdivision level

715
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.240
that we have applied to get an accurate displacement.

716
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:08.570
Now this subdivision level from the modifier does not affect

717
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.110
the resolution that you have available for vertex colors.

718
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.720
That is just the actual resolution of the mesh.

719
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.140
So switching it off for painting doesn't make a difference.

720
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.830
It's still going to be a little bit smoother afterwards when we apply the modifier.

721
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.940
Yeah.

722
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.240
As you can see here

723
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.030
but with the modifier you are not able to paint

724
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.010
in additional detail in between the actual points of the mesh

725
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.440
by the way. You can clear your canvas again

726
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.530
by pressing shift K.

727
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.530
With why does your foreground color selected

728
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:51.980
and you can simply swap the colors that you're using by pressing X.

729
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.070
So if I white is my foreground color and press shift K.

730
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.030
I get the complete white canvas again.

731
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.820
And I just

732
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.620
simply drawing

733
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.220
a very basic pattern

734
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.820
of black dots

735
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.430
and that's what we're going to use for the base

736
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.620
mask to mix between the plaster and the wooden structure.

737
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.520
So that's adam this vertical area that we just created

738
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.810
the regular name is always just call

739
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.720
and if you just add the viewer note to it, you can see

740
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.120
that is perfectly represented in the shader itself.

741
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.060
We can simply just use it as it is because it's just a black and white mask.

742
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.020
But if you wanted to you could actually even color coded

743
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.580
and use multiple mosques within one vertical

744
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.020
and then you can split the RGB channels like this

745
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.520
to have individual mosques

746
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.620
for different things. But here

747
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.820
it does not make a difference because it's just a black and white mosque.

748
00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:00.230
And for now let's just set it up in a way that it very simply mixes between two shakers

749
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.820
for that. I just

750
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.730
combined the two shakers with a mixed note

751
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.110
and as the mixed factor,

752
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.620
I'm just gonna grab these vertex colors and plug them in here.

753
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.020
So let's take a look what this looks like now

754
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.120
and you can already see a couple of problems

755
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.740
the first one very obviously being that the transparency should not be everywhere,

756
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.510
but only where the wooden structure is exposed.

757
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.730
So we have to combine

758
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.020
this

759
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.720
vertex color

760
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.520
mask with the mask for the transparency as well.

761
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.930
So I just added another mode

762
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.620
and now set it to maximum

763
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.430
to combine it with the vertex colors

764
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.820
which gives us this mask as you can see.

765
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.110
Mhm

766
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.620
And now the transparency only happens in the area

767
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.310
where the when structure is actually exposed

768
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:06.920
but now because we're using a gradient mosque and not a sharp bullion mosque.

769
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.710
Yeah,

770
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.020
you can see that it doesn't make a difference which type of

771
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.720
transparency will use if you remember I said this to alpha clip

772
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.100
which just checks if the transparency is

773
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.010
above or below a certain threshold

774
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.220
but if it's dead for example, I use alpha blend.

775
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.610
It will actually also consider the values in between and looked like this

776
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:34.270
but later on we don't want to have a final gradient for the mosque.

777
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.300
So I'm just going to set this back to off

778
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.810
a cliff because this is a little bit more performant.

779
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.320
Okay, so let's address the next problem that we have which is that?

780
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.810
The height mask is still 100% taken from the structure

781
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.520
and this results in a messed up normal map for the parts where the plaster is.

782
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.930
So instead let's also mix the height maps together.

783
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.300
I just use a map range known to mix between them

784
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.420
and I use again the mosque that we created

785
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:07.770
as the value input and then mix between the

786
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.100
height map for the wooden structure which is this

787
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:21.160
And a height map for the plaster that we have yet to create. But let's

788
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.600
for now just keep it at one

789
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.390
and as you can see it blends between the height

790
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.510
maps and now it looks a little bit more accurate.

791
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.910
So now we've taken care of the most important parts of mixing these together.

792
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.520
Let's actually address the mosque itself which is

793
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.710
right now still the very simple gradient mosque.

794
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:47.550
I do want to keep the gradient for now to have a smooth fall off of the height map.

795
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.890
So for now I'm going to add in a map

796
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.000
range note to just adjust the range of this gradient.

797
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:59.310
I want the level of where it starts to be 100% wooden structure

798
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.410
To be when the value of the Vertex Colors is exactly 0.5.

799
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.500
So I set the from men as .5

800
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.700
And as you can see all the values that were 0.5 are now exactly zero.

801
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.090
And the map is getting a little bit sharper

802
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.700
and now I want to drag the upper

803
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.210
Limit a little bit lower to like 0.7.

804
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.610
So I still have this nice little transition

805
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.300
but it's

806
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.410
much sharper than it was before.

807
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.710
But also I'm going to change this to smooth step to have a more smooth transition

808
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.210
then to get the actual sharp bullying mosque,

809
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.100
I'm adding in a greater than node

810
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.600
set to zero.

811
00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.910
So I get a mask of where it's exactly black and where it's anything more than black

812
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.710
and then I have this and this is going to

813
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.700
be the mosque that I'm using to mix between the shoulders

814
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.300
while

815
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.400
this gradient. I'm still going to use for the height map

816
00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.610
and now it's already connected in the way I wanted this greater

817
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.000
than note goes into the reroute note that I'm using for the mosque

818
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.300
and if we take a look at this

819
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.200
you can see that now we have a sharp transition

820
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.790
but this mask right now is not reflecting any of the shader itself.

821
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.000
It's just the mask that we painted in

822
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.410
and it looks very artificial. So let's adjust it a little bit.

823
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.410
First I want to add just some variation by using a noise texture

824
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:45.790
and this noise texture. I'm going to use to adjust the vertex color map that I created

825
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.500
and here it is important that we have these gradients

826
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.730
even though we're getting rid of the gradients right after because

827
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:58.430
if we use this noise texture to adjust the gradient mosque,

828
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:03.240
we still have the information from inside and outside of the mosque.

829
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.500
I talked about that in the blending and masking video

830
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.400
and the way I want to

831
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.990
combined these maps is by adding the noise on top.

832
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.000
But if I simply use the noise as it is

833
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.720
you can see that it shifts everything to higher values which is not what I want.

834
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.700
So first I have to

835
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.000
is a subtract node

836
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.890
subtracting 0.5 to center the noise around zero

837
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.390
and then what I do

838
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.700
what you probably see me doing often is adding another multiply node

839
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.500
to scale the effect.

840
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.280
So I get higher

841
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.900
extremes of values.

842
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:53.790
And now if you take a look at the adjusted mask again you can see

843
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.590
that there is some variation with the noise which we can control with the scaling

844
00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:02.490
and obviously you can control the size of this noise and all the parameters.

845
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.090
And next

846
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.410
I want to do some variation depending on the

847
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.160
base texture of the actual pattern that we use.

848
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.780
Because if we take a look back at the shader

849
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:19.130
you can see that this noise adds some variation and it looks a little bit nicer.

850
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.190
But still

851
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.790
it's not depending on the texture itself, it looks very unrealistic.

852
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:29.900
So let's add some dependency on the actual texture

853
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.490
and what I want to use for that is a

854
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.400
base texture of the structure that we're creating here.

855
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.390
And I want to make the distribution of the plaster

856
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.400
depending on these gaps

857
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.690
between the horizontal bars.

858
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.750
Because what the effect I want to create

859
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.290
is to have some plasters stuck in between there

860
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.700
and the base texture. A need for that is simply

861
00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.900
the ping pong output

862
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.310
that were used for the horizontal bars

863
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.770
which has exactly what we need a high value in the center and low values outside

864
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.270
and for now I'm gonna add just this on top

865
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:17.490
but this is not going to be what we end up with because when we take a look at the shader,

866
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.180
it looks like this,

867
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.080
which you know, is interesting but not we wanted

868
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.270
so to adjust this,

869
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.490
I'm going to use a

870
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.580
Rgb curves. Note.

871
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:32.580
Yeah,

872
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:40.070
and because of the fact that this ping pong base texture goes from exactly 0 to 1,

873
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.180
we can simply control the whole profile of the curve

874
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.080
with his note

875
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.490
and you can see how much control I have over this now.

876
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.770
So first thing I want to do is

877
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.490
invert the shape

878
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.490
to get it more in the direction of what I was talking about and then

879
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:08.190
shape it a little bit more by adding a smooth curve on the end here, so we get these nice

880
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.850
round ing's

881
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.470
then I want to create a little bit of a

882
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.080
bump that actually goes inwards a little bit here,

883
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.080
but now the effect is way too strong

884
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.190
so I'll add another multiply node

885
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.180
to tune it down

886
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.770
and with this factor now

887
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.980
I can simply control how strong the effect is supposed to be.

888
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.770
So I do some more adjustments, I want to bump here to be a little bit more subtle

889
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.490
and

890
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.440
maybe the bump on top is not in the right position.

891
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.190
So let's put it a little bit more here

892
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.680
and yeah, this looks more like what I was aiming for

893
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.580
and this is already the basic set up for the mask done.

894
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:59.580
Let's see how this works when I actually use the vertex painting

895
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:04.070
and you can see that you have some very nice control

896
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:10.770
the noise affect the variation with the noise creates these islands of

897
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:16.980
plaster within areas that are actually completely black in the base mosque.

898
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:20.180
So if you want less of that you can tune it down.

899
00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.270
But yes, just a very nice

900
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:33.260
effect to be able to just paint in with a simple mask, the material depending

901
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.980
on the base textures themselves

902
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.070
and you can use this effect for all sorts of things.

903
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:45.070
Now for this shader there's actually only one single thing left to do

904
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.480
apart from creating a frame for these notes

905
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:54.970
and that is integrating the height map correctly because right now

906
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.560
if you remember we still have this height simply set to one.

907
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:05.970
Also I said that I want to use the gradient that comes out of this map range. Note

908
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.250
to define the high profile

909
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.270
so let's grab another

910
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.990
color curves. Note

911
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:18.180
to be able to directly control the profile of this edge

912
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.410
and then another map range note to be able to set

913
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.920
the range of what the height is supposed to be.

914
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.370
So the low part

915
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.180
should be on top of the bars

916
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:30.770
which was at

917
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.380
0.5

918
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.380
and the top part

919
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.270
can then be chosen, I'm going to take it at

920
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.270
0.6

921
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:44.370
and this then I can simply plug into the height input for the

922
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.180
plaster which was here

923
00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.270
and the height map that results out of this

924
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.170
looks like that then

925
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.060
which has done the full height map of the shader.

926
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.570
And if we take a look at the old thing,

927
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.560
you can see that it looks like this and we got like a nice edge on the sides

928
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.060
and now it even looks a little bit better when you're painting in the plaster

929
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:16.550
and it's very smooth again if you still have the subdivision on

930
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.470
it will be much more choppy.

931
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.170
But the subdivision is what you need if you want to take a look at the shader

932
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.440
in

933
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.960
cycles rendered view

934
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.260
because without the subdivision there will not be enough

935
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.470
geometry for the displacement to work with. So let's turn this back on

936
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.170
and you can see that this works quite well.

937
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.250
I'm just going to give the second wall the new material as well

938
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.990
as you can see there's not much of a difference.

939
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.970
Let's give this surrender.

940
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.700
And by the power of editing that was super fast for you.

941
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:05.480
It took five minutes for me with Denoix zing and here we go there.

942
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.160
The shader is with the whole scene

943
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:10.860
and yeah,

944
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:15.160
it looks slightly different than what I had which is mostly just the color choice

945
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.060
but there we are, you can do more adjustments or just

946
00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.560
paint away

947
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:28.260
and yeah, this is the dynamic shading set up for the advanced wall shader
