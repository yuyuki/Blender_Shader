Hello and welcome to the next work for example.

1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.960
You were going to take a look at how to create this volumetric fire

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.650
that is also animated as you can see

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.920
and the note graph of this is considerably smaller

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.620
than the ones we have talked about before.

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.920
So this video is going to be quite a bit shorter but in comparison

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060
to the previous shade is that we talked about the work for examples.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.000
This one is actually animated and volumetric.

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.550
So these two things are setting it apart from the shade as we have done.

9
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.900
So let's get started but I'll actually not use this file this

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.280
time to create the new material but I'm going to start in

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.250
a completely new file because there are some things that you have

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.460
to keep in mind when you're working with volumetrics in particular.

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.460
So here I am in a new file, I just opened up the shader editor and change nothing else.

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.050
I'm just going to delete everything but the cube

15
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.760
that we are going to create the shader on

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.550
and for the environment set the background just to black.

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.860
So we have a united contrast for a fire

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.530
and in the view port I go into the material

19
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.890
preview and then the settings enable the scene world.

20
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.060
So it's actually black.

21
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.990
It's also to have a nice view here disable the floor and the axis.

22
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.690
So now everything is black and just to see what we are doing,

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.660
let's just add in a volumetric shader.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460
I just use the principle volume shader here

25
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.510
and right now there is no light source.

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.060
So we have to set up the emission so we actually see what happens,

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.260
Just turn the emission to one

28
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.290
And the density way down to 0.0 is everyone.

29
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.750
And as you can see we see our volume but it's not great quality.

30
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.460
So it's just the volume settings for Evie

31
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.460
but you have to be in the selection for the IV render engine

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.360
and then go down to the volumetrics panel

33
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530
and there are a couple of settings that we can change

34
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.050
and all of them are quite important for the equality.

35
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910
The most important part is actually to set the start

36
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.990
and the end parameter in a reasonable range here.

37
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.430
I just want to work on this fire very close up so I don't need to see it from

38
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.140
far away and that means I can just adjust this

39
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.320
end parameter to be very close to the camera,

40
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.950
let's say four m

41
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
but as you can see immediately gets much better in quality.

42
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.410
But also when I zoom out you can see that the end parameter here really

43
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.860
plays a role and just cuts off what we can see from the volume.

44
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.320
So maybe we have to choose something larger.

45
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.160
Let's just go for 10 m and then we shouldn't have a problem with this.

46
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.000
The starting m parameters can really play a

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.550
large role in optimizing the performance and quality

48
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.850
and additionally to that we have the tile size,

49
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.350
I'll keep this on four pixels for now

50
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.750
And the samples.

51
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.260
We have to see how the performance goes but this should be fine.

52
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.430
And because I'm going to create a fire for a simple fireplace animation.

53
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.790
I don't need any specific volumetric lighting or shadows from any other objects.

54
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.060
So now that the file is all set up to start working on the flame,

55
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.560
let's do just that and start by including some texture coordinates.

56
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.460
I want the shape of the fire to change with this cube.

57
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.860
So I'm just going to grab the generated foreign it's

58
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.480
and as you can already notice when we use the preview note,

59
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.460
it just connects it to the surface output.

60
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.360
If you want a preview for the volume,

61
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.750
we have to connect that to the emission color.

62
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.060
But still this is very difficult to actually see what the values are.

63
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.050
So there's no real great way to preview value maps and vector fields for a volume.

64
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.660
But we can work around that.

65
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.610
So let's just add a blob in the center. So we can already see what is going on.

66
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.750
And later on manipulate that into the shape of a flame.

67
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.450
I just grab

68
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.060
back to the mouth, nude,

69
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.459
subtract 0.5 in all dimensions

70
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.060
because now you have to keep in mind that we have to work with all three dimensions

71
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.460
because all the values are going to be relevant later on for the volume

72
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.590
and now that the factories are centered.

73
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.550
I scaled them

74
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.750
by two to make sure that in all directions of

75
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.210
the cube it goes from negative 12 positive one.

76
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.950
And then that the values are centered and normalized.

77
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.260
I just use the length operation and then invert this value

78
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360
By subtracting it from one.

79
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.360
And as you can see now we have a nice sphere in the center of this cube

80
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.150
and the radius of this sphere is determined with this value.

81
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.960
Now it's already set this up to the kind of like a flame.

82
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.000
I just choose the emission colours, some something orange

83
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.760
like this.

84
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.160
And then use this actually as the emission strength

85
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.500
because when you overshoot the emission strength to something greater than one,

86
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.150
it will also change the color.

87
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.150
So if you just multiply this value by

88
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.760
hi factory

89
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.850
you can see that. It also changes the color

90
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.620
to have some control over this profile

91
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.360
allowed a RGB curves note in between

92
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.450
So we have a nice peak in the center

93
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.860
gradient to the edge.

94
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.550
Mhm.

95
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.260
Now it's already adding some detail into the shape

96
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.660
for that. I'll just use a fortnight texture

97
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.960
That he said to smooth of one.

98
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.660
Well now we can just take the same coordinate space

99
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.360
and then I want to add this

100
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.060
to the mask of the blob

101
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.060
to get some variation.

102
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.560
But now this is Overblowing everything a little bit. So

103
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.560
that's just before that subtract

104
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.950
another value

105
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.660
to add some more verticality to the shapes.

106
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.760
I'm going to add a vector math notes set to multiply.

107
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.960
First set it all to one so it doesn't change anything

108
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.160
and then adjust

109
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.660
how this shape is supposed to be

110
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.550
cranking down the zet factory

111
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.260
and up the other ones.

112
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.540
And this is already looking more vertical because

113
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.160
it is essentially stretched along the Z axis.

114
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.350
Now I want to add some variation to the pattern by introducing another noise texture

115
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.250
and then using the same old trick

116
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.750
with the mix. Rgb knows set to linear light

117
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.560
to destroy the coronets.

118
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.850
This is just going to add some more interest to the pattern.

119
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.160
Okay, this is all still looking like a blob though.

120
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.260
It's all very spherical

121
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.660
to change that. I want to warp the shape along the Z axis

122
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.050
to do that. I simply separate the components and put them back together

123
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.650
and for the component I just throw in. A math note is set to power

124
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.040
and as you can see by changing this exponent value here,

125
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.960
I can shift the weight of this blob.

126
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.730
But also the detailed pattern is staying in place.

127
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.050
That's because these are still using the regular generated

128
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.160
coordinates but I want to use an effect here

129
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.700
that makes the flames essentially stretch along the top

130
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.260
so they don't have the same pattern all over.

131
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.160
I want to do that because usually a flame

132
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.350
accelerates to the top

133
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.230
so it moves quicker and then that means that the flames

134
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.350
are going to be stretched on the top a little bit.

135
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.860
And to have this reflected in the pattern here.

136
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.120
I can simply use the East coast and also to create the

137
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.059
detail and now you can see that the whole thing is getting stretched

138
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.460
so it's finally add some movement to the flame and animated.

139
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.250
I just added a value node

140
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.700
and type in

141
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.559
hashtag frame

142
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.850
mhm

143
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.850
And that very easily and nicely gives me a

144
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.910
driver that always returns me the current frame.

145
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.860
And as I scrub through the timeline, you can see how the value always changes.

146
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.150
Let's just call this frame

147
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.760
and now we can use it to manipulate the shader to make it animated.

148
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.360
First I want to have some speed control

149
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.960
so I'm going to manipulate this time by dividing it

150
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.150
the way value

151
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.560
and this value now essentially controls how long it takes

152
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.760
for the output value here

153
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.350
to go from 0-1. For example, if I set this to 100,

154
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.160
It will take exactly 100 frames

155
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.820
Until the upward value here reaches one because the 100

156
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.250
frame is going to be divided by this value.

157
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.040
So it has a nice and easy way to think about this.

158
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.430
Let's just set it to 100 now we can still adjust the speed later on.

159
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.260
And the first thing I want to do for the animation,

160
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.210
it's just shifting this pattern along the Z axis because the flames are going

161
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.650
to move upwards so to do that I just manipulate the coordinate map.

162
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.470
Just adding a vector meth node set to subtract.

163
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.760
And the tricky part now is to find out where we have to subtract this vector.

164
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.950
If we subtract it all the way in front

165
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:11.780
then

166
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.760
everything is going to shift

167
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.160
even the overall shape

168
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.750
and that's not what we want.

169
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.560
We only wanted to be manipulating the actual detail

170
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.160
so instead I'm going to add it here.

171
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.660
So the top part that is making the general blob is still unaffected

172
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.350
and as you can see if I just shift this year

173
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.860
already get kind of like a nice fire animation going.

174
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.740
And there is also something interesting happening that I

175
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.730
pointed to before because of the fact that we

176
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.590
are stretching these coordinates in a way that they

177
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.350
are more elongated towards the top of the flame.

178
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.860
It also looks like the patron is moving faster on the top.

179
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.960
It even gets more obvious when I

180
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.160
change this exponents value

181
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.060
and that is exactly the effect that was aiming for.

182
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.300
So for this effect to work,

183
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.610
there's actually really important where the vector is added on top.

184
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.640
The important takeaway from this is that not only the time takes a

185
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.160
large role for the speed of something but especially also the distance.

186
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.810
So although I am changing this value here with the same speed everywhere

187
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.070
across the cube because of the fact that the coronets are warped,

188
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.030
it looks like the texture is moving upwards faster towards the top of the cube.

189
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.240
So now we just have to drive this vector

190
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.260
here with the animated component of the shader.

191
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.180
I'll just take a combined next ways Eno

192
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.560
and plug in the time parameter into the component.

193
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.060
And now you can see that we nicely have an animation.

194
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.020
It's quite slow at the moment though so

195
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.060
let's decrease this value to something like 40 and

196
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.110
now you can see that we have a nice animation when I scrub through the timeline,

197
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.460
here.

198
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.090
when you try to just play back the animation

199
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.850
you'll see that everything is a little bit blurry.

200
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.190
The reason for that is that he is trying to deny noise the image.

201
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.650
If you want to work around that you can just simply open up a new preview window.

202
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.410
But using the playback for volumetrics is not always

203
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.690
good anyways because it requires a lot of performance.

204
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.750
So usually to preview the actual time component of the animation of volumes,

205
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.340
you actually have to give it a preview render.

206
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.390
There won't be any blurring in the actual rendering to give the

207
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.360
animation some more interest there's one more thing I want to do,

208
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.090
I want the pageant to actually change over time as

209
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.660
well and not only shift from bottom to top.

210
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.660
So the easiest thing to do that is simply changing the dimension

211
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.750
of the noise textures that we are using

212
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.660
2 40

213
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.860
and then using the w parameter that is exposed then

214
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.260
to animate it as well.

215
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.750
So we are going to be both shifting and also animating the noise for that.

216
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.760
I just add another divide note to set a

217
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.420
different speed for this part of the animation.

218
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.760
I'm just going to set that 220

219
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.550
and then use this value to stick it into the W

220
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.960
parameter of the both the noises that we are using.

221
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.260
So if I now simply turn off the shifting.

222
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.460
So the only part of the animation is the W parameter.

223
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.850
You can see that it changes over time

224
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.260
but it is missing this very specific movement to the top. So let's turn that on again

225
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.750
and there we go.

226
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.160
That is the very basic fire shader,

227
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.740
fine tuning the starting and parameters of the volumetric settings even more.

228
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.960
We'll give you a much nicer preview frame rate as you can see here.

229
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.580
If you want something more realistic you can

230
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.420
for example change the smoothness of the warren.

231
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:14.760
Oy

232
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.460
and the detailed level of the noise.

233
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.290
But if you want something really realistic you're

234
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.160
probably not getting around doing actual simulation.

235
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.210
Of course there's also more that you can do with just the procedural method.

236
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.760
I just wanted to show you a quite simple to achieve. Example shader

237
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.490
as the chapter was also about drivers in general.

238
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.200
I want to extend these work for example for

239
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.360
another feature which is adding some wind into the mix

240
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.430
that looks like this and it can be controlled using this empty here.

241
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.360
So if you just rotated around

242
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.250
you can see that the direction of the wind also changes

243
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.760
and I can also adjust these the strength of the wind by changing the scale.

244
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.430
Okay, let's start adding the wind.

245
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.340
The way I'm planning this is to create an offset in the direction of the wind,

246
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.910
depending on the zet component.

247
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.260
For now for testing, I'm just going to shift

248
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.860
in a specified direction

249
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.720
using a vector meth node and the subtract operation.

250
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.080
And I'm going to do this for the whole of

251
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.140
the set up directly after using the initial current system.

252
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.560
So for now just change its value. Can see that the fire shifts

253
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.060
but I don't want a constant shift of the whole volume.

254
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.660
I just want to shift it

255
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.160
at the top. So I just duplicate this note and send it to scale.

256
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.960
And now I can select the direction of the offset with this vector here,

257
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.460
but I still have this

258
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.520
scale component to change how strong it is affected what I want to plug

259
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.190
into the scale now is a gradient going from the bottom to the top.

260
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.460
So I just take another texture chord note, fully generate coordinates

261
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.150
and separate the X. Y. Z. Components.

262
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.360
And for now just

263
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.560
plug these, that component into the scale

264
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.560
and as you can see this already kind of looks like what we are going for.

265
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.710
But right now this is just very linear.

266
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.130
I want to be able to have some more

267
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.350
control and introduce some more roundness to this transition.

268
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.960
So in between,

269
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.120
I also plug a RGB curves note.

270
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.460
And now as you can see, I can nicely adjust the profile

271
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.660
of how this is screwed,

272
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.550
I'll just go through something like this.

273
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.110
It gives me a little bit of a smoother transition

274
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.860
at the bottom and if I play the animation,

275
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.970
you can see that. It already kind of works

276
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.070
right now. It's just way too strong. So let's just tuned this down a little bit.

277
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:50.570
Mhm.

278
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.740
And now we're actually ready to introduce the empty object

279
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.850
for the control of the direction of the wind.

280
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.930
So let's add in an empty geologist choose the single arrow,

281
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.160
which is a nice indication of the direction.

282
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.670
And now we have to link this in the shader with some drivers.

283
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.790
What I want to get is the rotation of this empty.

284
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.460
So I'll just create an input for the rotation vector by using a combined X, Y Z node

285
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.950
and then at a driver

286
00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.950
for this driver here,

287
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.250
I'll just keep it at what it is as an

288
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.950
expression which just references the variable that we can define

289
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.000
and for the variable

290
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.360
I choose as the object that empty that I just created

291
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.360
right now. This is marked as read So it does not work.

292
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.360
Let's just update the dependencies and as you can see now the error is resolved

293
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.460
But as the type I don't want the location but the rotation.

294
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:53.860
So just choose the exploitation for this. The rest we can just leave at auto oiler

295
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.060
and world space.

296
00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.620
If you have some more complicated setups this can be quite tricky.

297
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.170
But here this will do just fine.

298
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.960
I just press update dependencies again,

299
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.460
that doesn't hurt.

300
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.160
And if I select the empty,

301
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.650
obviously the shader notary goes away because this empty doesn't have a material.

302
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.290
So to keep the interface visible here,

303
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.560
I'll just pinned as a window to the current material.

304
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.670
And now you can see if I change the irritation around. It also updates in the note.

305
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.360
Now I just copy this driver and pasted to the other components of this vector.

306
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.460
And then I have to obviously also change the type to the irritation.

307
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.550
And these that rotation.

308
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.030
Now I have a rotation vector for the three dimensional rotation of these empty.

309
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.270
And it's accessible in the shade of a tree.

310
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.730
Now we only have to convert this somehow in a directional vector.

311
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.770
The easiest way to do this is just using a vector rotate note

312
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.760
because what we have here is a oil rotation.

313
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.160
And if I just switch the factory type two oiler,

314
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.820
we can simply use

315
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.660
this vector here as the rotation vector.

316
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.270
But we also have to specify an input

317
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.860
and as the input, I just use the unit vector along the Z axis.

318
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.330
001.

319
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.410
Because this is the direction vector that it

320
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.960
has right now without any rotation applied,

321
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.450
it just points up along the Z axis.

322
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.960
So if I take this as the base fracture

323
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.450
and then apply the same rotation

324
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.170
that this object has.

325
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.460
I always receive the correct direction vector

326
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.850
and I can simply plug this

327
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.170
into the input of the scale

328
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.210
and it should already work the problem right now

329
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.260
is just that the wind is pointing straight up

330
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.580
and that can be a little bit of a problem.

331
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.460
So I just want to rotate this victory into the xy plane

332
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.170
and here we go. Now you can see

333
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.760
that it correctly references the direction depending on this. Empty.

334
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.070
But now I also want to be able to change the

335
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.270
strength of this wind with the scale of the empty.

336
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.260
I can simply do that by for example adding another scale node

337
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.460
to adjust the vector of the wind direction.

338
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.560
And now I can simply drive this scale factor.

339
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.760
We had another driver

340
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.560
which links

341
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.670
also to the empathy

342
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.560
and as the type I just choose the average scale.

343
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.270
But we have to be a little bit careful here

344
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.660
because the value of this scale factor is previously won

345
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.960
when creating the driver.

346
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.060
It also adjusted it to add one.

347
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.460
So I just want to delete this and only transfer over the actual scale

348
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.090
and as you can see

349
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.270
the strength of the wind is nicely bound to the scale of this. Empty

350
00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.450
mm

351
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.270
oh

352
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.350
mm.
