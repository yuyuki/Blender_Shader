00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.620
So let's start with the first work, for example,

1
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.550
where I'm going to show you how to create this wall shader from start to finish

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.860
so you can see every step of the way

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.040
and I'm still going to explain everything that I do.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.050
Yeah, this wall shader is quite simple for the first one that I show you

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
and um it basically has two main aspects

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.560
to it which is one the general surface structure

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.960
and then

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.160
there's

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.860
gradient towards the edge which makes it look more used.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.550
And the cool thing about that is that

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.660
when I changed the scale of this plane,

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.860
the effect scales along with it but the structure does not, it's not distorted.

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.550
This also works from within the added view as well

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.050
as you can see here.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760
Okay, so let's start by just

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.250
deleting this, adding in a new plane

17
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.660
and

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.260
looking it up with the standard material.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.360
We're just going to ignore this principle be sdf for now

20
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.460
and take a look at what um

21
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.560
tax records we want to use.

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.060
So

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.660
as I said with the tax recording space, which should change with the geometry,

24
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.060
I want to use

25
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.960
generated coronets

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.760
because these just sticks to the surface as

27
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.650
I want, I want the gradient to appear.

28
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.260
It's just

29
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.060
go back a few steps and

30
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.450
first start with

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.650
adding a vector math known

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.760
and centering the coordinates by subtracting

33
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.160
0.5

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.750
because first the coordinates started going from 0 to 1 on the X and Y axis

35
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.060
and I want to center the origin

36
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.060
towards the middle of the plane.

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.930
Now the coordinates go from negative .5 to positive .5 in both directions.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.460
And I'll just add an a multiply known

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.060
to make them go from negative 12 positive one by multiplying by 24 X and Y.

40
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.550
And also I'm going to multiply by zero for the component

41
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.270
because I don't want to consider the component at all because this

42
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.660
shader is only going to be for flat surfaces like this.

43
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.260
And then let me add in a absolute note

44
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.260
which as you can already see

45
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.560
as these gradients

46
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.820
on both the X

47
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.360
and the Y axis is going from the center towards the edge.

48
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.460
So I already have both these and I can just split those up by using the separate Xy Xena

49
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.710
and as you can see on the X component we have

50
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.260
this gradient from the center to the edge in the X direction

51
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.460
and in the Y component, the same thing for the for the Y direction.

52
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.450
Now to combine those

53
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.660
into the shape that I need

54
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.450
I can just add in a

55
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.750
math noon

56
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.860
and set that thing to maximum

57
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.660
plug in both X and Y component.

58
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.400
And as you can see already I have this

59
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.760
shape where

60
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.110
depending on which part of the plane I'm in,

61
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.450
I get this gradient towards the edge

62
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.760
which is already looking quite good.

63
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.660
So if I just added a colorado know to control a little bit this gradient

64
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.650
you can see that it has the wanted effect.

65
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.460
Now I do want to smooth out the

66
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.550
edges here because right now they're very harsh and I want to have like uh

67
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.410
certain curvature here on the edges.

68
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.940
So instead of just the maximum node,

69
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.560
I'm going to change that to the smooth maximum node.

70
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.450
And now I have nice full control over the radius of this smoothing here.

71
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.160
All right. And that's already

72
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.050
pretty much the mask for this edge. Taken care of

73
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.050
one thing that I do want to add to this edge

74
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.450
is some kind of variation by adding in a noise texture.

75
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.360
And

76
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.550
just before I apply the colorado operation, I want to add this noise on top.

77
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.640
Yeah,

78
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.750
but I don't want to offset the complete mosque. I just want to

79
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.460
At the noise on top so I need the noise to be centered around zero

80
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.660
And we're due for that. It's just that i subtract .5

81
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.960
as you can see here.

82
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.350
It's all in the positive values, subtracting .5 centuries around zero. Getting

83
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.260
basically have the values into the negative area

84
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.850
and yeah, then I can also add in a multiply known

85
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.650
to scale this effect up and down.

86
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.960
Yeah. And if I add it now,

87
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.660
the overall values don't get uh

88
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.460
offset but just distorted.

89
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.060
And so does the mosque that I get. And you can already see how this is going to

90
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.150
look later on.

91
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.360
I do want to change the scale of this mosque because I think the effect

92
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.760
looks better this way.

93
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.760
Okay,

94
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.670
now let's move on to the overall surface structure.

95
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.050
I'm just going to use another noise texture

96
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.960
And to get a nice effect with this one.

97
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.060
I'm going to crank the roughness all the way up to one

98
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.850
and now I get this nice

99
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.050
shifting of detail

100
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.060
with this slider

101
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.260
without really uh

102
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.650
changing the overall look but rather just the love of detail,

103
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.260
I'm just going to put that to five for now

104
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.700
and yeah, now it's time to actually worry a little bit about the,

105
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.260
about the shading itself.

106
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.660
I'm first going to add in a bump known

107
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.550
to get

108
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.060
to give the whole thing a little bit of

109
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.460
bumpiness

110
00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.760
surface structure

111
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.650
and we're just gonna put this into the height input

112
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.260
and connect the normal input to the shader node.

113
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.120
Also,

114
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.140
I'm just going to quickly rotate the plane on the X axis 90

115
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.050
degrees because the wall is going to be standing up straight like this

116
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.350
and there we go. We got those surface structure already.

117
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.160
It's just a little bit

118
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.560
too much, little bit harsh. So I'm going to crack down the distance, way way down

119
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.060
2 0.2

120
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.260
for now

121
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.050
that I also want the

122
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.760
structured to affect the roughness

123
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.760
and to gain some easy control over the minimum and maximum values

124
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.260
that this

125
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.060
roughness is supposed to have. I just added a map range. Known

126
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.360
plug that into the rap roughness here

127
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.260
and then she was like

128
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.750
.7.5.

129
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.230
You can always tweet those settings to what you think looks

130
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.850
best or what you want your plaster to look like.

131
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.350
Okay, so let's finally worry about the actual color map

132
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.059
and my approach for this one is just going to be

133
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.460
a final mix. Known that mixes between the

134
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.450
hi

135
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.059
tone and the low tone on the edge.

136
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.260
Maybe like this

137
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.160
can see later on if that works.

138
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.660
And I'm basically going to use this mosque here.

139
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.260
Still compiling. Here we go.

140
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.960
Now this doesn't look too great. But uh, bear with me.

141
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.560
No, I can just

142
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.160
and called the surface structure as well. And I'm going to do that by using

143
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.860
a

144
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.050
linear light

145
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.250
operation

146
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.060
because that already takes into account that I have a noise texture that is

147
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.950
Centered around .5,

148
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.760
which is essentially the same

149
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.760
thing that I did here

150
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.630
just using this color mix notes. So these operations are basically the same.

151
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.550
This this one is just a little bit more efficient

152
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.050
but takes a little bit more time to set up.

153
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.340
And now the surface structure also informs this

154
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.250
gradient here and it looks a little bit

155
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.060
more fitting

156
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.360
and now you want to just

157
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.060
tweak everything.

158
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.660
Maybe

159
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.650
the contrast of the causes a little bit too much.

160
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.550
But the basic idea works fine.

161
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.660
The one thing that we haven't

162
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:36.260
taken care of here is that the structure still scale with the plane

163
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.060
and that's because we haven't defined any

164
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.380
coordinates to use here, so it just falls back to the standard coordinates.

165
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.550
But what I want to use here

166
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.960
is something else which is the

167
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.390
global coordinates

168
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.460
in the geometry note.

169
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.360
And as you can see now,

170
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.060
it works just as intended.

171
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.660
And right now

172
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.630
the texture is like a little bit stylized.

173
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.460
If you want something more realistic, you can just crank up the detail level here.

174
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.650
Still not super realistic.

175
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.550
But I thought the shade would be a nice start

176
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.460
for the examples to see the whole workflow.
