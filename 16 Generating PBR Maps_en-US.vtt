00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.250
if you want to create your own textures from photographs,

1
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.580
you have to either use advanced techniques to separate the different passes of

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.490
light information or use software that tries to do that for you.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.720
Most online material databases nowadays provide a

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.390
full set of PBR textures per material

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.950
that you can simply plug into the principal Chatur the way they are.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.780
If you want to create an entirely procedural PBR based trader,

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.050
you have to generate all those different maps individually.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.320
That can be both an obstacle and

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.370
an opportunity to integrate additional information.

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.860
And here I want to go over how to generally approach this.

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.330
If you want the best of both worlds,

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.880
you can mix a procedural workflow with traditional elements.

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.860
We will talk about that in another chapter.

14
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.800
An advantage of the procedural approach when you are creating the individual maps

15
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.970
is that you don't have to generate one map out of the other.

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.810
Like you have to end using a base photograph in

17
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.600
the no tree that generates your procedural texture map.

18
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.030
You have all the successive steps available to

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.250
create the other texture maps with as well.

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.660
So you have additional information that helps you to more

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.660
accurately and independently to find the individual PBR mess.

22
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.000
What you usually want is to have the different maps inform each other

23
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.270
but not generate one completely out of the information of the other.

24
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.360
Doing that usually leads to a very one dimensional look.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.040
We will talk about how to practically mix and blend those

26
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.360
maps together more specifically in the next chapter about shader composition.

27
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.490
Also there are more in depth work, for example,

28
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.220
showing the whole process of creating procedural shakers here,

29
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.370
I want to lay the focus on the general idea to generate

30
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.360
the different PBR maps and how they usually correlate to one another.

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.150
Something that you can keep in mind for all the different PBR maps.

32
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.270
Is that a good method of approaching shading in general?

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.520
Is thinking logically about the natural properties of the material you

34
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.250
are attempting whether that may be a surface existing in nature,

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.570
something artificially created or anything at all.

36
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.500
If you want to achieve a convincing PBR shader,

37
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.220
it is important to grounded in reality by

38
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.550
thinking about how it would logically occur.

39
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.660
That concept even applies for stylized traders to a certain extent

40
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.700
to give a few examples here that could be thinking

41
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.650
about where dust would be more likely to accumulate,

42
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.330
where paint would more easily chip off or how a floor is worn down by years of use

43
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.260
this line of reasoning ripples through all the levels of PBR maps.

44
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.320
Looking at and observing.

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.560
Reference is a great way of getting aware of these connections

46
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.300
and details like these.

47
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.630
Being faithful to the nature of things is what

48
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.760
gives a shader a lot more character and authenticity.

49
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.950
The workflow of which PBR map you should start with depends on the material itself,

50
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800
but at the time,

51
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.030
I personally find myself starting with the height map as this

52
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.800
map gives information over the geometry and the overall structure.

53
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.260
It also usually informs the other maps in some capacity

54
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.290
but something you can rely on is that usually you want

55
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.950
to develop your shader out of a set of general based textures

56
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.650
that are then incorporated in all the individual PBR maps

57
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.520
with these base textures.

58
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.240
I mean anything from simple to complex elements,

59
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.160
structures and shapes that the material is made out of

60
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.150
these textures don't have to be very specific.

61
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.200
They can be anything but they should have some sort of association with

62
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.080
the final material that you have in mind to give some examples.

63
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.930
Those could be a chiseled noise texture for a rocky surface.

64
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.560
A gradient along the geometry for a change in wetness,

65
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.860
the lines to define the grain of wood or a single stitch on an embroidery.

66
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.350
A procedural shader is usually made up of several of these based textures.

67
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.820
Most parameters of the principal be sdf are single values that can

68
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.050
be accessed as either a simple constant value or a value map.

69
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.070
I want to group these maps together in this section as they are

70
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.310
General value maps that describe the variation

71
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.020
of surface properties like metallic roughness,

72
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.260
sheen etcetera.

73
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.490
If a constant value is not sufficient for these maps,

74
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.970
the best way to create a value map is selecting the right base texture and mapping it

75
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.100
to a range of the intended values Using either a map range note or a colorado.

76
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.260
That works quite straightforward by selecting the levels of minimum

77
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.060
and maximum and the levels those are mapped to.

78
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.960
The most important thing about these textures is to respect the

79
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.050
PBR context of what those Children values imply about the material.

80
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.420
One of the maps I want to single out here is

81
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.350
the color map generating color maps is usually a matter of good

82
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.500
based textures as you generally want the base of your color

83
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.010
map to only include the actual albedo color without lighting information,

84
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
it can usually be simply created using the gradients and masks of the

85
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.380
base textures information like ambient occlusion and

86
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.410
variations can be added on top.

87
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.480
Later on, you can simply use a color ramp to turn the base texture into a color map.

88
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.390
But something to be cautious of is that especially for the color map.

89
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.500
Using only a single base texture creates a very one dimensional look.

90
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.720
As I mentioned before.

91
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.230
A good way to introduce some variation is to use multiple

92
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.650
colour rams and planned between them with a mask from a noise

93
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.950
that gives you a lot of control over the different color configurations.

94
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.160
This method creates

95
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.510
and even surfaces that seem very uniform,

96
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.100
usually have some form of variation in the color in case

97
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.530
you are using a color noise as your base texture.

98
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.350
You can simply use the three RGB channels for this technique.

99
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.950
Just use the separate RGB note to split it up.

100
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.320
Use two of the outputs with color ramps for the color passes

101
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.260
and the third one for the mosque to blend between them.

102
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.720
That automatically introduces some variation that and this is

103
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.360
important is not depending on one single base texture,

104
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.000
you want the variation to be disconnected from the main base texture.

105
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.990
Otherwise it's applied along the same

106
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.060
axis and introduces no additional information.

107
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.260
Other PBR maps can also influence and be integrated into the color map.

108
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.460
For example, materials that get wet appear darker in those spots.

109
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.320
That effect can be essential to the material

110
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.300
and can be dynamically connected to the erogenous layer

111
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.960
that dictates how wet the surface looks.

112
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.610
Maps that simply adjust the color map can easily be integrated using

113
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.050
a color mix note with the appropriate blend mode on top.

114
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.580
Another map that has to be created differently than just

115
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.290
mapping values to a range is the infamous normal map.

116
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.660
The simplest way to create a normal map in the shader editor is by creating a

117
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.550
bump map and using the bump note to convert it into a normal vector map.

118
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.060
A bump map is a simple value map

119
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.440
that functions similar to the height map

120
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.070
to give information about the surface detail.

121
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.550
The bump note then effectively calculates the changes in the bump map

122
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.900
and returns the normal factors standing on top of that bumpy surface.

123
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.580
Not all detail makes sense to be loaded onto a normal map though,

124
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.700
depending on the resolution that you will observe the shader in,

125
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.620
you can instead of very high frequency detail just increase the

126
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.230
roughness as that's essentially how the microscopic detail is represented.

127
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.830
Also the procedural nature of the shader lets you

128
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.330
zoom in without picks elation of the map,

129
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.560
but that does not mean that your texture has

130
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.260
to look good from an arbitrary amount of zoom.

131
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.790
That is just not feasible.

132
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.560
Focus on making it accurate for a reasonable range of detail for the intended use

133
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.270
into the other extreme.

134
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.030
More large scale service detail might be better

135
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.690
to be including the geometry for example,

136
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.880
by using a height map for displacement.

137
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.930
If you're choosing to use a displacement,

138
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.700
you can also alternatively refrain from using a normal map at all and instead use

139
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.050
the displacement map directly to take care of the surface detail at the same time.

140
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.880
You do that by selecting displacement and bump and

141
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.680
the displacement settings of the material that way,

142
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.820
depending on the level of subdivision,

143
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.370
the detail is either taken care of by the

144
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.780
displacement itself or by the generated normal map.

145
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.360
The height map is also a map that I want to talk about separately here.

146
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.270
Height map has a very specific geometrical association with

147
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.760
the material that means that to be accurate,

148
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.970
it has to be addressed more carefully than some of the other maps.

149
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.520
That is also true for the normal map, but because they are so strongly connected,

150
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.860
I want to show it for the height map specifically.

151
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.750
An easy way to precisely control the profile of a height map

152
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.240
is using a linear gradient and controlling it with an RGB curves.

153
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.550
Note

154
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.100
that works in the exact same way that we

155
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.510
have been doing this for creating shapes earlier.

156
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.130
But now the map values can be used at the height directly.

157
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.360
You can combine this technique with all the other methods of controlling values

158
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.240
and shapes that you have seen and precisely generate height maps that way.

159
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.860
But of course you don't have to only use precise shapes.

160
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.560
You can also use noise textures, for example, for the height map.

161
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.580
And even here in RgB curves note can offer some useful control.

162
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.020
You can control the profile of the noise to pronounce it in a very specific way.

163
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.110
A height map can also be a great way to combine

164
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.350
other PBR mess depending on the geometrical properties of the material,

165
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.690
even when you're not planning to use it for the displacement itself,

166
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.160
I will elaborate on this in the next chapter about shader composition.

167
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.590
Something I want to point out as a conclusion is that

168
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.530
you want to keep in mind what information you use where,

169
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.140
when you're creating the individual PPR maps from the base textures.

170
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.190
This goes hand in hand with what I mentioned multiple times throughout the video.

171
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.770
When you create multiple maps from the exact same information,

172
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.460
it might look one dimensional and artificial.

173
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.960
I wanted to quickly pick up this point again, under the term of correlation

174
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.560
correlation, loosely speaking,

175
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.650
describes to what magnitude two or more things have a re occurring relationship.

176
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.440
For example,

177
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.660
when I simply used the height map to define the color map and nothing else,

178
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.990
then every spot of the same height also has the exact same color.

179
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.740
Some level of correlation is a good thing as you want,

180
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.140
the different PBR maps to support and correspond to each other,

181
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.760
but also you usually want some variation that highly depends on the material,

182
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.960
but it is definitely something to think about.
