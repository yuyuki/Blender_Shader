00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.000
one thing that is crucial when composing a shader of multiple parts is that you

1
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.730
correctly layer them together using mosques and

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.250
that concerns all the individual PBR maps.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.510
Important for this is that you know

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.510
how to handle combining and manipulating mosques,

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.700
which is something I talked about in

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.370
the previous chapter about texture composition.

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.060
But we will also touch on this again in this video.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.020
In this part,

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.340
I want to go over what is important to consider when composing a shader out

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.060
of multiple elements and how to set the shader up for a dynamic masking workflow.

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.660
For that reason I adapted the example seen again

12
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.510
by removing some of the plaster on the wall,

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.260
exposing a wooden structure beneath it and adding puddles of water to the floor.

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.300
I want to just quickly reiterate some of the more

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.260
important things to keep in mind for working with masks

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.560
to receive a simple black and white mosque with a sharp edge

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.000
to mix without a transition from a value map,

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.450
you can simply use a math node set to great than or less than

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.260
alternatively to generate their mask with a transition.

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.750
You can use for example a map range node

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.560
with that. You can select start and end points of the mosque

22
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.890
and also choose a different interpolation type to get an even smoother transition.

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.430
The transition is something important to think about because

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.780
a lot of the time blending to materials in

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.590
a convincing way is not just a matter of

26
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.650
transitioning between two shakers with a single mosque.

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.610
Very important when layering together multiple materials in a shader is

28
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.440
to take care of blending the individual PBR maps correctly.

29
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.070
You can simply use multiple principle be sdf shader nodes and blend

30
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.510
between them using a mix trader note with a mask texture,

31
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.350
but a lot of the time.

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.260
That is not the best way of doing this.

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.450
One reason why blending the individual PBR maps is usually better

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.800
is that it will increase the performance of the shader as

35
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.500
only one main principle is the f shader note is used

36
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.560
that makes the shader easier for the render engine to process.

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.520
Another reason is simply that I can look different as what

38
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.150
happens while blending the materials is a fundamentally different process.

39
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.850
The thing with blending together materials is that they usually don't really

40
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.660
just fade one into the other like they are separate materials.

41
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.660
That of course it depends on the use case,

42
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.860
but let's take a look at a change in wetness. For example,

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.350
in the previous chapter I showed you the example of a melting

44
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.760
Suzanne head using dynamic paint that what's the floor and the carpet

45
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.960
In that example the water forms a puddle on the

46
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.560
floor that has a sharp transition between wet and dry.

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.250
But on the carpet, the fibers are gradually soaked in the water.

48
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.700
And in that example the difference in the individual methods of

49
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.960
blending either whole shade ear's or individual maps is quite noticeable.

50
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.990
The reason for that is that blending the whole shakers simply blends between

51
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.170
a shaded with a glossy surface and one with a rough surface.

52
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.850
Whereas blending the maps results in a gradual change of the roughness,

53
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.050
making the blended result look much more natural.

54
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.550
This phenomenon is the shading equivalent of blending a blurred

55
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.210
with a sharp image versus gradually increasing the blurring radius.

56
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.550
With one method,

57
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.140
you can clearly see that the transition is simply a mixture of

58
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.860
two separate images and the other one looks much more natural and appealing

59
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.520
but simply using a mix shader node is much

60
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.960
more convenient and keeps the notary much better organized.

61
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.840
So blending between multiple shader is like that is one of these small noting sins.

62
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.650
You can allow yourself when the context allows it and you don't rely on it too often

63
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.220
in this example,

64
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.240
I am using this technique to blend between the plastic

65
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.650
material of the wall and the underlying wooden structure.

66
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.510
The reason that I do that here is that

67
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.560
I have a sharp edge between the materials anyways

68
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.380
And it gives me a very useful visual differentiation

69
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.760
between the two material layers of the Shader.

70
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.170
I don't use this method to mix the individual

71
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.260
elements of the structure to mix between the word,

72
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.060
the background and the bolts.

73
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.050
There, I mix the individual PBR maps,

74
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.130
you can also use the information that you gain from

75
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.790
your PBR maps to generate masks for layering materials.

76
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.440
For example, the height map has a high structural relevance for the material

77
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.620
and as such,

78
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.280
it oftentimes makes a lot of sense to use this

79
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.260
map to mix together materials based on their height.

80
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.150
A classic example of this is adding puddles of water to a ground plane

81
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.670
That's just for demonstration,

82
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.430
grab the floor from the example scene and

83
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.460
create some paddles based on the height map.

84
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.030
The wooden boards here are bent and tilted,

85
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.660
which gives some variation the height already.

86
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.750
But I want to go one step further by adding

87
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.960
a noise texture and offsetting the height map by that.

88
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.850
That gives us a very nice overall way venous to form the palace from

89
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.190
then we can simply grab a math note set to less than two Moscow,

90
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.860
all the areas that are below a certain level.

91
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.860
I'll just make that level a separate value note so we can control it later.

92
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.460
And this mosque can then be nicely used to mix in a wet surface to the shader.

93
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.650
To do that. Now the mosque has to be incorporated into all the relevant PBR maps.

94
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.590
Those are most importantly for the paddles, the roughness and the height map,

95
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.250
but also the color map has to be adjusted as well

96
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.760
as the layer of dust on the edges of the room.

97
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.540
Let's just start with adapting the color first.

98
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.700
I want the wet areas to appear darker to reflect

99
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.360
the energy conservation effect of surface is covered in water.

100
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.660
So I simply use a mix RGB note and started to multiply

101
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.610
when I now plugged the mask texture into the factory input.

102
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.450
I can't control the darkening of only the wet areas with the second color input.

103
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.850
Next, most importantly, the roughness of the shader has to be adjusted

104
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.650
as the roughness map is a value map

105
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.060
here instead of the mix. RGB note, I am using the map range note

106
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.850
with that. I can simply blend the roughness value of the wet areas into the map

107
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.430
to remove the mixed industrial later from any wet areas.

108
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.860
I simply subtract the mask of the wet areas from the dust mask

109
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.430
but I have to make sure to clamp the resulting values between zero and one.

110
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.160
So the mask does not have any negative values which can create some weird artifacts.

111
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.150
And lastly, I have to integrate the water level into the height map. To do that.

112
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.370
I simply use a maximum operation between the height map of the floorboards

113
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.050
and the water level to trim away any areas below that level.

114
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.990
And now you can see that the distribution of

115
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.550
the water accurately takes into account the height map.

116
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.640
Let me just crank up the scale of displacement

117
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.290
and tilt these boards by a ridiculous amount.

118
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.660
So we can see how it works.

119
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.710
And if we now just get rid of the displacement

120
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.240
and look at the floor in the material preview.

121
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.560
You can see that still works in the same way

122
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.660
in this sense,

123
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.790
a height map can even be useful if you

124
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.390
are not planning to use it for actual displacement,

125
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.360
but simply to mix between materials based on the material's properties.

126
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.260
That is great to get a convincing result of mixing to surface types.

127
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.560
You can see that this way we have, for example,

128
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.190
some floorboards peeking out of the puddles with an adjustable water level rather

129
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.160
than just using the nice texture its own to mix between the materials.

130
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.520
The method I showed you is obviously much more accurate

131
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.860
as it respects the actual context of the height information

132
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.970
in that same senses with the height map,

133
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.020
you can also use all sorts of other texture maps

134
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.760
to guide the mask that you're using for blending materials.

135
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.330
That can be incredibly useful to automatically adapt a very

136
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.730
simple mask like that noise texture that we used in

137
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.030
a way that makes sense in the context of the

138
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.650
material for the layering of the world for example,

139
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.230
I incorporated the structure of the wooden

140
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.650
bars into the distribution of the plaster.

141
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.410
The basic mask itself is very simple and it looks

142
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.820
like this and using some base texture of the shader,

143
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.750
it is adapted to look like this

144
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.070
to be able to influence a mask like that.

145
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.080
Something that I mentioned a while back about shape control.

146
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.669
Place another role again,

147
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.860
you want to be able to work with gradual information on your base textures.

148
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.150
If you are left with a simple black and white mask with a sharp edge.

149
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.860
there is not much you can do in terms of influencing

150
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.160
the shape of the edge by using a guy texture on top

151
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.750
what you want to have for that is a gradual transition instead of a sharp edge.

152
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.760
So you also have the information of the shape on the inside on the outside of the edge.

153
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.860
You can still turn this gradient into a sharp mosque afterwards.

154
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.340
There is also what I'm doing in this example but the important part is that

155
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.360
you apply the texture that guides the mask before that great information is lost.

156
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.850
To have an influence on the shape of the mask.

157
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.320
How you apply the guide texture depends on the use case but in most cases you will want

158
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.840
to either use it in a map range note or add it on top of the mask.

159
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.360
If I just do that here and look at the resulting mask

160
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.400
Again while subtracting 0.5 and multiplying by a

161
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.960
factor to get control over the strength.

162
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.760
You can see that the noise nicely influences the shape of the mask.

163
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.870
How that works.

164
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.060
Is essentially that the guide texture prioritizes certain parts

165
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.020
to influence how the basic mask is applied.

166
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.440
And so combining based textures from the material with the mosque is a very

167
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.450
powerful way to guide the mask in a sensible way with the material.

168
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.760
So let's talk about the way I am generating the base mask in this example

169
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.920
you can of course just use some procedural texture like for example

170
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.460
a noise texture or even a simple gradient to generate the base mosque

171
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.440
or any texture really.

172
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.860
But here I want to introduce you to a way to actually add a manual control at this point

173
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.440
an incredibly useful workflow for blending together multiple materials is using

174
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.360
vertex colors to paint a mosque directly on the geometry.

175
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.320
Vertex colors are a type of vertex data that

176
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.290
stores an RGB color per vertex to the mesh.

177
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.300
And that way you can very easily paint a color map

178
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.490
onto the mesh itself without using image textures and UV.

179
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.160
Unwrapping

180
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.730
vertex colors can easily be accessed in the shader

181
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.360
notes as well to incorporate them in a shader.

182
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.440
I have shown vertex colors before and they're used together with dynamic paint to

183
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.850
make a shader interact with the proximity of other objects in the previous chapter.

184
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.700
Because of the fact that a vertex color only stores

185
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.420
one color per vertex depending on the mesh density.

186
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.920
That can turn out in a very low resolution and for that reason it

187
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.160
is usually ineffective to use them to paint and surface detail or sharp mosques.

188
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.940
If you must contains rather smooth gradients

189
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.560
though and large differences in detail distribution.

190
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.760
They can be much more efficient than using image textures

191
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.010
with the broken down wall.

192
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.560
You can see the vertex color workflow in action and how powerful

193
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.150
it is that I can simply paint in a rough mask of where

194
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.560
the plaster should be ripped off the wall without having to worry about

195
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.460
the structural detail which is taken care of by the shader itself.

196
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.630
The various color map that I am painting is a

197
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.160
simple black and white mosque without any particular detail.

198
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.860
The black areas will be the parts with missing plaster

199
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.770
with black as foreground color and white as background colour is selected.

200
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.840
I can simply paint away the plaster and when

201
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.560
pressing control I can paint it back in again.

202
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.050
This is where the true power of procedural masking really comes into play

203
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.840
when you are painting in a mosque like this.

204
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.200
You don't have to use this mask directly

205
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.860
to blend between the different materials that either gives

206
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.710
you a very artificial look and does not follow

207
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.710
any natural way of blending two materials together.

208
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.860
Or it requires you to manually paint the mosque with a lot of detail

209
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.490
Instead you can use the information about the material that you have in your no

210
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.210
tree to guide the mask and combine the different materials in a natural way.

211
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.360
As I mentioned before,

212
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.690
you get very easy control over the general distribution of the mosque.

213
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.440
The detail is handled automatically by the shader which can turn

214
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.820
it into an incredibly powerful and easy to use tool.

215
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.090
You can of course also use image texture painting for

216
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.060
this exact same workflow just as a quick tip.

217
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.190
You can even use the individual RGB channels of the vertex color

218
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.560
separately to control different masks with a single vertex color layer.

219
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.860
That is more efficient, but it comes at the cost of less convenient usage.

220
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.450
This more advanced war shader, which is controllable with vertex color,

221
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.310
is actually the subject of this chapter's work.

222
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.190
For example.

223
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.900
There you will see how to create the whole shader,

224
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.330
including the underlying bone structure,

225
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.960
and I go over the vertex colors set up again with a bit more time.

226
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.660
So if you want to see that head over to the work for examples, to check it out

227
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.350
either now or after watching the remaining videos of this chapter.
