00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.490
most shapes,

1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.360
patterns and textures in general are not created a single string of operations.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.220
Usually you have to combine separate segments and

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.350
there are multiple different ways to do so.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.680
In this section we will go over the basics of how to combine textures and mosques.

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.760
So we can apply these methods in the following chapters.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.570
This part is highly linked to the earlier section about general value control.

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.110
The main difference is that there we were

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.160
mostly working with constant values to add or multiply

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.240
well now I want to focus on the combination

10
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.360
of maps that are not constant over the surface.

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.940
As a simple example,

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.060
I'm just going to create two circular gradients that are overlapping.

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.270
I create these simply by shifting the currents with a subtract node and

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.550
then using a length note to get a map of the radius.

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.310
Let's invert the map by subtracting it from one.

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.350
So we get a circle with a radius of one that

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.959
has a value of zero on the edge and one the center

18
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.310
for Now I will just convert these circles into mosques with a

19
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.120
hard edge by using a math notes set to greater than zero.

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.440
These mosques now contain no other values than zero and

21
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.430
one no hidden negative values and no values in between.

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.250
As you can see in the graph view,

23
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.680
combining these masks is now comparable to simple boolean operations.

24
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.430
The simplest way of getting the union of both

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.060
shapes is using a math notes set to maximum

26
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.650
and for the intersection. Using it set to minimum

27
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.750
if you want to get a mask of where they are equal or different,

28
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.260
you can set it to compare.

29
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.020
Now let's delete the great then nodes and go back to the gradient information.

30
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.960
You can see how, where the two textures have the same value. It creates an edge

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.660
because we are still combining it with the minimum operation.

32
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.210
That edge can be easily smoothed out by

33
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.520
just using the smooth minimum or maximum instead.

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.520
What is unique about the maximum and minimum operations is

35
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.960
that the textures don't affect or overlay each other.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.460
They are simply masked out by which one is greater or lesser.

37
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.870
But if you do want to have the textures affect each other.

38
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.090
You can simply use other operations to show this part.

39
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.520
Let me quickly add in the noise texture as well.

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.450
When I now add the noise on top you can see that it is applied over the whole circle.

41
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.970
There is just one issue that the average of these values is shifted as well,

42
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.110
increasing the size of the circle.

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.800
The reason for that is that the noise is centered around 0.5.

44
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.460
As we have seen before to counter that we can simply subtract 0.5

45
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.450
And now that the values are centered around zero.

46
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.290
We can also scale the effect of the noise

47
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.670
by adding a multiplication with a factor here.

48
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.460
You can also see the immense benefit of having

49
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.930
the additional great information and the negative values.

50
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.460
If we had clamped the circle textures back here to arrange between zero and one,

51
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.160
the noise would just as well have affected the black areas

52
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
and of course after centering its values around zero,

53
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.160
clapping the noise texture makes a huge difference as well.

54
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.240
So using the add operation,

55
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.100
offsets the values with the same strength independent on the value of the

56
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.940
other map as the strength of the noise is the same everywhere.

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.560
If you use the multiply operation instead,

58
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.950
the noise effect is also scaled with the gradient map

59
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.680
but now having the noise centered around zero is not doing

60
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.360
us a favor while adding zero does not change anything.

61
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.280
For multiplication.

62
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.470
The neutral element that does not change anything is multiplying by one.

63
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.860
So for this we want the values to be centered around one instead of zero.

64
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.360
I will however still keep this setup subtracting 0.5 1st

65
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.100
and then multiplying by a factor to adjust the

66
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.670
strength and then I just add one afterwards.

67
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.560
Otherwise the values just fly away. Keeping a sense of the order here is important.

68
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.460
You can always just go through the setup step by step and look at the value graph.

69
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.050
If you are not sure why something does not work as you expected

70
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.209
now that the values are centered around one,

71
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.780
you can see that it has the promised effect.

72
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.360
The strength of the noise depends on the radiant.

73
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.150
That also means that the effect that the edges zero and the shape stays the same.

74
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.740
Another thing I want to point out here is how to use the

75
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.380
additional information in the negative values to soften the edge of the shape,

76
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.010
you can just take another map range note and

77
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.980
set the interpolation to smooth or even smoother step.

78
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.760
The benefit of the negative values is that you then

79
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.760
can fade out the gradient beyond the initial edge.

80
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.700
So usually try to keep as much information in the texture

81
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.160
as long as possible without doing unnecessary clamping of the values

82
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.180
up to this point, we have only talked about value maps, transitioning to color maps.

83
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.350
Most of the concepts are the same.

84
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.470
Just instead of a single channel,

85
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.240
you have to deal with three channels at the same time.

86
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.160
The simplest way to apply color to a value map is using the color ramp note,

87
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.950
You can use it to define a color gradient that is

88
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.660
mapped until the input values in the range from 0-1.

89
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.840
It supports multiple different interpolation types and it is

90
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.950
very intuitive to use to combine multiple column maps.

91
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.780
You can technically use the vector math node as the

92
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.170
RGB channels are treated the same way as the X,

93
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.060
Y Z channels

94
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.350
but more convenient to use And specialist for blending colors is the mix RgB note.

95
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.560
It blends between two column maps based on a mask factor between zero and 1.

96
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.200
Apart from the mixed type,

97
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.160
it is also a bunch of other useful blend modes

98
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.860
that you may be familiar with from other software.

99
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.020
The general behavior that is always the same

100
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.350
is that the factor between zero and one always

101
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.250
controls the influence of the second color input while

102
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.760
the first input is used as the basis.

103
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.460
I will not go over all blend modes but just as an example overlay is a very nice way of

104
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.260
both brightening and darkening in color with a texture that

105
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
is centered around 0.5 without blowing out whites or blacks.

106
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.660
You can also use the mix RGB no to process value maps

107
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.010
but it is a bit less efficient and you

108
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.020
can substitute all the operations that it supports.

109
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.660
Also using Math notes.

110
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.260
Some are very obvious like add and multiply.

111
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.660
I was a less obvious like overly.

112
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.720
I'm not going to go over them here but the

113
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.320
one that I want to point out is the simple mixed

114
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.890
mode for the values it might not be in the

115
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.020
name but you can simply use the map range node,

116
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.980
fulfill the exact same task for values as the mixed note does for colours,

117
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.160
you simply have to plug in the factor into the value input

118
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.180
and the two maps into the two men and two max inputs.

119
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.430
Leave the from inputs at zero and one and make sure it is still on linear

120
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.900
and as you can see there is no difference

121
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.530
that is as much as I want to say about combining and blending textures and masks.

122
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.060
For now,

123
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.960
the operation you want to use is highly depending on what you want to achieve.

124
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.250
So I recommend getting more familiar how different

125
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.490
maps combined with the individual operations that I have

126
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.660
shown and observing the results with the value graph

127
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.360
tool to see more easily what to expect.

128
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.280
It is generally a good tip to try and stay aware of where the map is

129
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.760
zero and where it is one as those two are the important levels for multiplication,

130
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.760
addition and some other operations,

131
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.060
and they are usually easy to recognize.

132
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.560
I will talk about how to use these methods for masking

133
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.020
and blending together multiple different shooters in a later chapter,

134
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.560
I will also be using them a lot in the examples.
