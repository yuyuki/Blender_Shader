Hello and welcome to the next work for example

1
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.710
here we have the window with the animated raindrops.

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.160
So the result is going to look like this.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.960
I want to already now that we are looking at this

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.950
go over a couple of the things that I want to create with the shader

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.940
for a lot of shader is it is very important to look

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.540
at reference and and while you're looking at the reference already,

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.560
thinking about how to create the effect that you want to make

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.010
the shader that you're going to create this

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.860
specifically the shader on the glass playing here

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.350
and that is made up of different parts

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.060
to one part very simply there are these

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.260
4th of the window that have a gradient

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.060
of roughness

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.270
to simulate a film of tiny droplets

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.150
and then there are the animated drops

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.160
but these also

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.660
Are made out of two different parts.

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.960
There are obviously the drops that are streaming down the window

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
but also there is another layer of drops that are just sitting there

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.960
and growing and shrinking in size where another drop is flowing over them.

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.250
So these are the two layers of animated droplets that I want to create

22
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.850
and the way these are structured

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.950
is that they have specific lanes

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.250
so the drops never cross each other's path.

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.160
But there is a lot of variation in the length of the drops and their speed.

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.750
So now that we talked a little bit about how I want to achieve this effect,

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.450
let's start with the shader and just as per usual,

28
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.160
I'm just starting by deleting the material

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950
and starting fresh

30
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.760
as always. I just start with the coronets space

31
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.560
so I grabbed the texture corner node

32
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.660
and what I want to use is the object coordinates.

33
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.150
And first I want to create the lanes for the drops.

34
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.550
So I just use a separate X Y Z node

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.759
to get the X. Component

36
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.060
and then use the same old trick

37
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.450
with multiplication

38
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.750
and then a fraction operation

39
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.250
that gives me already the individual lanes.

40
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.790
And then additionally to the fraction operation,

41
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.960
I also want a snap operation to get a different value for each lane.

42
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.350
The instrument has to be chosen to one.

43
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.360
Then it's the same scale as for the fraction operations.

44
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.160
If I now on top of this snapped cord and value,

45
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.860
I add a noise texture,

46
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.860
a white noise

47
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.080
I get a Iran and value which is different for each of the lanes

48
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.150
and that is what I'm going to use later on.

49
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.660
So that's already the basic structure of the lanes done.

50
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.360
But of course the raindrops don't just streamed down perfectly straight

51
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.180
so before this,

52
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.660
I also want to introduce some distortion.

53
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.760
I do this the same way as always with a nice texture

54
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.260
that I use

55
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.750
in a linear light operation on top of the coordinate space.

56
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.560
I can just adjust the scale and detail

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.950
to give some subtle variation.

58
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.860
First I want to focus on the raindrops that are streaming down the window

59
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.250
and for those I'm going to define the lanes as a cellular pattern.

60
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.250
The X component for each cell

61
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.250
is already what we have from this fraction operation.

62
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.260
So now I have to work on the Y component as well

63
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.350
and the Y component is something that is going to be a little bit more difficult

64
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.650
because this plays into how the animation works.

65
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.560
Let's just first take a look at the Y component as it is.

66
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.460
I want to also use the fraction operation

67
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.750
on the Y component in the same way

68
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.950
but here the cellular ization should be different for each individual lane

69
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.850
for now I'll just add in the fraction operation so you can see what I mean

70
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.320
when I just use a combined

71
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.860
with the note and use this as the Y component

72
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.360
and what we previously had is the X component.

73
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.750
You can see the vector map of the cells that we get

74
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.660
not to change the Y component for each individual lane.

75
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.760
There's a couple of things I want to do

76
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.360
first. That's again just the length of these streaks by adding a multiply node

77
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.960
this way can scale how these tricks look.

78
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.150
As I said,

79
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.150
this should be different for each lane and that's where we can use this white noise.

80
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.960
I just choose a separate RGB. No, because we need multiple different random values

81
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.660
and then I split the color output

82
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.160
so for

83
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.160
adjusting the length.

84
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.080
Let's just take the right channel but I don't just want to plug it in

85
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.250
as it is because the random value here is just between zero and one.

86
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.260
Instead. I want to add a map range before

87
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.310
and that way I can specifically define

88
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.750
the range of the different skills that I want

89
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.730
now I don't want it to multiply by zero ever

90
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.560
because that would result in an infinitely long streak.

91
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.260
Instead I want

92
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.060
The minimum to be something like 0.1

93
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.260
Which means that the street

94
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.650
increases in length by a factor of 10.

95
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.750
But now because we simply scaled the component depending on the lane,

96
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.660
they all got their zero point still at the center.

97
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.060
So I also want to apply shift.

98
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.260
So I just do that after the scaling using a subtract operation

99
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.860
and for that use the second round of value.

100
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.610
And now let's introduce some actual animation.

101
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.360
As you have seen before

102
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.360
for some procedural animation, I just add a value, input, note

103
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.160
and type in hash frame

104
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.260
that gives me the value of the current frame

105
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.860
and that I can use as a time parameter.

106
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.160
Now the animation type that I want here is having the droplets flow down the window

107
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.150
and achieve that by offsetting the coordinates.

108
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.850
So here I just

109
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.850
use an ad operation

110
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.850
and as you can see

111
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.560
adding a higher value,

112
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.440
shift the drops

113
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.560
lower down.

114
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.660
So if I just scale

115
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.020
the frame parameter

116
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.960
to change the speed

117
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.890
with the divide operation

118
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.800
and connected this

119
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.860
you can see that it already gives us some animation

120
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.180
because of the fact that we add this

121
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.460
offset after we scaled the coordinates for the length

122
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.510
every time. The

123
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.760
opposite value

124
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.560
is incremental by exactly one. So if I go from 1 to 2 or three

125
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.060
it looks exactly the same.

126
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.960
And for that reason

127
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.550
if I just plug this scale value in here we get a reputation on the pattern

128
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.010
After exactly 100 frames.

129
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.360
If that is an effect that you want

130
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.290
you can that way actually loop the animation

131
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.860
without any nasty jumping that you can see.

132
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.150
But here instead of having a loop mobile animation

133
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.360
I want something that does not repeat

134
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.060
and also I want some more variation in the speed of these.

135
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.050
The only variation in the speed right now

136
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.360
comes from the different length.

137
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.760
So if I change the regime and the length to something

138
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.150
less obvious I can see that they move approximately with the same speed.

139
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.840
So on top of this I also want to introduce

140
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.260
some more variation and the speed of each lane.

141
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.160
And to do that I use the third random value.

142
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.150
So I add another map range. Know to be able to control the speed,

143
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.560
plug the random value into it

144
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.090
and then change the two men and two max to the speed parameters.

145
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.850
That should be the limits

146
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.050
What I have right now. 100.

147
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.960
It's what I'm going to use as my slowest speed.

148
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.659
I just said that as the

149
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.059
maximum

150
00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:46.060
And as my fastest speed which is a lower value, I just choose something like 40

151
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.850
which is going to be this fast.

152
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.560
And then just by using the opera of this map range known

153
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.050
as the division,

154
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.900
I get some more variation

155
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.050
and also

156
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.560
as you can see

157
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.220
there is no perfect loop anymore but that is

158
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.350
fine because I rather want something that does not repeat

159
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.650
And if I now change the end frame to something like 10,000

160
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.960
you can see that it nicely plays over the whole animation

161
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.860
and there was no exact repetition anymore

162
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.650
and from this year you can already see where this is going.

163
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.950
I do want to create some more variation in the

164
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.930
white component here though because right now on each lane,

165
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.760
every single streak of water has the same length

166
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.660
to break this up. Just a little bit,

167
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.750
I'm going to

168
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.750
use the fraction to coordinates,

169
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.180
Then multiply them by

170
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.350
something like 1.5

171
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.350
and then use another fraction operation on top.

172
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.850
And as you can see

173
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.750
that breaks the pattern up a little bit

174
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.860
And it gets more obvious when they lower this value to something like 1.1

175
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.360
because then I have this additional small streak here

176
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.250
which is exactly

177
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.050
In this case 10% of the length of the other streak

178
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.920
Setting it to 1.5, makes it less obvious

179
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.150
but still breaks down the pattern a little bit.

180
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.260
Additionally I'm going to add another multiply note after that to be able to scale

181
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.050
the Y component of each

182
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.060
droplet

183
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.460
for now just to keep it at one.

184
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.360
But later on we can change that.

185
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.260
I'll just collapse

186
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.160
this little segment here

187
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.760
so it takes less space

188
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.360
and now we have the cells for a running drop that's ready to go

189
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.560
next. We have to create their shape.

190
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.740
The main wage of the droplets is obviously going

191
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.260
to be shifted to the bottom of the cells.

192
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.660
So when I center the coordinates

193
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.560
like I did previously with a subtract note

194
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.760
I only subtract 0.5 in the x direction

195
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.960
two centuries on the x axis

196
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.060
but on the Y axis

197
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.750
I'm only going to subtract a little bit because I want the center to be very low.

198
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.360
It's take 0.05

199
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.890
but then I still want the Y coordinate to go all the way to negative one.

200
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.040
So it's stretched asymmetrically to the top and to the bottom.

201
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.260
So at this point I separate the X. Y. Z components.

202
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.350
Mhm.

203
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.200
And to stretch them differently. I need a mask of what right now is less than zero.

204
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.460
So I'll just take a math node

205
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.760
said to less than zero

206
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.350
and then I have a mask of everything that is lower than zero in the Y component

207
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.650
to stretch the accordance. I need another vector math note

208
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.960
I just set this to multiply

209
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.660
That's first choose one

210
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.560
and then you can see that change in this nicely stretches the coronets

211
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.560
and now with this mosque I can build the stretch director here.

212
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.760
I just use a mix RGB known

213
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.630
which is just the simplest way to mask together

214
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.510
a vector map even though it's meant for colours.

215
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.050
And as the

216
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.750
first input

217
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.860
which is going to be in the places

218
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.150
above the center,

219
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.060
I'm just going to choose

220
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.660
The victory of 111

221
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.500
because I don't want any stretching

222
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.560
in this part. I only want distraction in the lower part.

223
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.860
So for the second input,

224
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.630
I'm going to build a vector

225
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.950
with the combined X Y Z note

226
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.710
And for the excellent quality I just choose one

227
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.350
because I don't want any stretching in that whatsoever.

228
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.160
But the white component has to correspond to the offset valley that it chose here.

229
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.770
So for that I'm just going to add in another value. No

230
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.860
Actually Saturday 2 0.05

231
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.160
and plug that in the Y component

232
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.060
to keep it consistent with the previous setup. I'm also going to

233
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.450
take the combine X Y Z node

234
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.270
with

235
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.760
this exact value

236
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.760
and 0.5 in the x component

237
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.260
for the subtraction.

238
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.450
That way we can control these values with the same input

239
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.960
And I also use this for the stretching.

240
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.750
We have to take a quick look at how this is actually used.

241
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.460
So to actually see what we are doing.

242
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.550
I'm just going to use a

243
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.050
length operation

244
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.770
and this right now is the exact opposite of what I need because

245
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:53.050
the vector map is multiplied with a small value is actually stretched,

246
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.560
but I want the value to be squished so I have to get the inverse factor,

247
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.360
but actually I can just simply change the multiplication to a division

248
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.660
and then I get the exact effect that I wanted,

249
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.850
I want the bottom of these streaks to be nice and round

250
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:18.260
and then from the center stretch along the y axis to the top,

251
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.450
dragging along the street behind.

252
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.450
And as you can see when we adjust this,

253
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.710
it still works

254
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.150
But .05 is already going in the right direction.

255
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.760
If I now go back to the multiplication factor that we set up earlier,

256
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.860
you can see that the higher value squishes these streaks down a little bit

257
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.960
and right now maybe they're a little bit too long

258
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.060
so I just squish them down by a factor of two.

259
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.660
Now we have the basis for the running streaks done,

260
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:53.800
but it's

261
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.860
actually already started converting them into the drop shader.

262
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.860
The shader is going to be mainly based on using a bump map.

263
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.060
So let's try and create something like a bump map for these raindrops

264
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.260
going from this

265
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.150
length value here.

266
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.760
I want to

267
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.450
first invert this map

268
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.260
by subtracting it from something like

269
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.860
is there a point to

270
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.050
and after the operation

271
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.160
there are still negative values in the black space.

272
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.860
So additionally

273
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.750
I had another mouth No, it's sad to smooth the maximum

274
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.350
Comparing it with zero

275
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.390
and jan increasing the distance.

276
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.150
It also makes it a little bit more smooth than the transition

277
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.790
for now. I'll just plug this into the height of this bump node.

278
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.760
You can see that it's kind of going in the right direction.

279
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.050
It is just way too harsh right now.

280
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.150
A lower the distance to 0.02

281
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.300
and then to get something

282
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.760
that is more rounded.

283
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.260
Also on top, add another math operation

284
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.260
set to power.

285
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.260
been going on for a very low exponents like 0.01

286
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.660
and as you can see that makes the profile much more round on the top

287
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.460
and more steep

288
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.960
at the bottom.

289
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.440
That gets more clear when I actually plugged the bump map

290
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.660
into the normal input of the principal B S D F

291
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.660
and then change it there.

292
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.160
The power operation is a nice and easy way to control the profile of this curve.

293
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.760
For the preview we're working on, I'm going to leave it at that for now.

294
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.850
Next to improve this pattern, I want to introduce some variation.

295
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.860
So I'll add some noise distortion as well.

296
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.770
I do that the same way as always with the linear light operation

297
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.670
and that just adds some more variation that the drops can follow.

298
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.170
Maybe this is a little bit too strong. I'll turn it down to a factor of 0.2.

299
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.859
Next up, I want to add the drops that are actually sitting in place

300
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.170
for these. I can't use the same cornices for the cells

301
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.170
as they are moving around. So I have to create some new governance for these.

302
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.060
But this is going to be a little bit easier than for the routing cells.

303
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.460
Just adding math, note and grab

304
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.860
the Y component from the beginning

305
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.770
And this one I am multiply

306
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.270
and then use the fraction operation as usual.

307
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160
Let's go for a multiplication with five.

308
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.360
Now here we could also go for a variation in length with a noise

309
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.670
but it won't be as a parent here.

310
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.260
What I do want is a variation in the offset.

311
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.350
So I also add a

312
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.090
add node

313
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.670
and I just use the same offsets for the Iranian droplets

314
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.460
that is not going to be visible

315
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.050
and now we play the animation, you can see that these stick in place.

316
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.050
So that's again take a combined X, Y z known,

317
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.360
use this as the white component

318
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.170
but then the same lane value as the X component

319
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.190
and then we already have the cell U V s fully setting their up. Let's

320
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.010
these are going to be a little bit easier than

321
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.170
the running ones because these can be entirely symmetrical.

322
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.960
So instead of having to squish them on the bottom,

323
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.270
I just simply use a vector math node

324
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.760
To align them in the exact center by subtracting 0.5 in the X&Y component.

325
00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.450
And then again adding a length operation

326
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.090
to get the radius

327
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.440
and same thing.

328
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.160
I subtract this length from

329
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.500
value. That's

330
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.950
Let's say 0.25

331
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.350
and that's what I'm going to use later on to combine them with the Iranian droplets.

332
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.960
But here as well I want to add some variation by distorting the coordinates

333
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.360
and I'm actually going to use the exact same noise texture.

334
00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.160
That means they will follow the same distortion and fit much nicer together.

335
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.460
So just the same as here right before the length operation are also

336
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.450
put the linear light operation with the same noise

337
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.360
but this one I want to make quite a bit stronger,

338
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.770
let's say

339
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.350
0.7

340
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.960
and this already looks like some nice and noisy pattern of raindrops

341
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.960
for now let's just add them together with the running drops.

342
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.760
So let's take a look at what we have here

343
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.560
for the running drops. We have a mask

344
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.560
That is already clamped to a minimum of zero

345
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.460
but the mask of the sitting drops

346
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.060
can still be negative in the black areas

347
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.350
so we shouldn't just add them on top of each other.

348
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.450
But use a maximum operation

349
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.260
here, I'll take the smooth maximum actually

350
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.560
and now we have a combination of the two mass

351
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.450
but this doesn't look right at all yet.

352
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.550
The sitting drop. It should be completely static

353
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.210
right now. It looks like the two maps are not influencing each other at all.

354
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.140
So first I want to make sure that when

355
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.660
two drops meat they actually increase in height.

356
00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.360
So I'll actually also add the maps together

357
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.170
before calculating the maximum.

358
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.560
Now they don't just simply phase through each other.

359
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.620
But now most importantly I also want to animate the sitting droplets.

360
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.960
What I want to do is create a swelling effect so they swell

361
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.680
and then again decrease in size

362
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.960
when they drop runs over them

363
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.260
to do that,

364
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.160
I add a math node

365
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.270
that subtracts from the mask

366
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.050
that way I can change their skill

367
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.080
and this subtraction value,

368
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.560
I want to then drive with the cornice of the surrounding droplets.

369
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.660
So let's go back where we got there. Why component

370
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.960
back here

371
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.960
and take this

372
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.570
into an RgB curves note because I want to be

373
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.050
able to manually control the profile of the swelling effect.

374
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.550
So let's just connect that in there

375
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.060
and now I'm just going to simply use this

376
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.660
as a value.

377
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.350
This is going to be in the completely wrong range.

378
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.170
So don't expect it to work immediately

379
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.860
but that's already the main idea.

380
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.960
So now we have to think a little bit about what those values you mean?

381
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.670
A higher value in the subtraction.

382
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.500
Well actually make the size of these droplets

383
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.560
decrease.

384
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.450
So I want the values in the beginning of a droplet running over it

385
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.260
and in the end

386
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.960
to be higher.

387
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.860
But because that is a little bit un intuitive

388
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.500
with the size,

389
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.170
I just want to use a map range note

390
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.170
and control the range that way.

391
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.760
So when this curve is going to be at a low value,

392
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.450
I want to be mapped to a high value for the subjection.

393
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.860
That's just simply invert this year

394
00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.270
By changing one and 0.

395
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.770
And now I can nicely just the profile of the swelling

396
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.740
which is supposed to be

397
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.170
at a low size

398
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.950
at the beginning and end

399
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.670
and then swelling in the middle.

400
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.900
I wanted to very quickly increase in the

401
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.770
beginning and then slowly decrease like this.

402
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.160
And that is already kind of the effect that I'm going for.

403
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.160
Let's take a look at this in combination.

404
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.670
And right now it looks like

405
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.080
once the Iranian drop has passed over the sitting drop,

406
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.290
they completely vanished which is not what I want.

407
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.950
So I have to decrease this subtraction value

408
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.850
to something that still leaves some remaining parts over

409
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.180
something like this.

410
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.460
And as you can see now they nicely swell

411
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.500
with the writing droplets.

412
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.050
It is very nice and animated.

413
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.060
Trade like this to have the different animated parts influencing each other.

414
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.360
So if you take a look at this

415
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.170
in the shaded view with the bump map,

416
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.300
it looks like this

417
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.160
and it is already quite close to what we are going for

418
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.670
next. I want to add some variation in the height.

419
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.060
So that's simply after the power operation

420
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.460
at a multiplication.

421
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.230
The factor I want for the multiplication is a random value for each cell for that.

422
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.760
I can just go back to the cornice of the cells

423
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.460
and let's take a combined X Y. Z. Note

424
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.060
to create the position factories.

425
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.930
So let's see.

426
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.270
I need the white component after the multiplication

427
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.460
and the offset with the animation is done.

428
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.360
So this is the component I need

429
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.050
and to get a different value for each cell.

430
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.560
I just use the snap operation again

431
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.170
and that's going to be my Y. Component.

432
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.550
This component of course increases with the animation

433
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.340
and for the X. Component I already have snapped coordinates

434
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.460
that are created for the different lanes

435
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.660
so I can just use these

436
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.950
And if I now plug this into a white noise texture

437
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.670
I nicely get different values for the different cells.

438
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.330
So let's just take the Iran and value

439
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.360
as the factor for the multiplication of the height

440
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.350
and as you can see that creates some nice variation.

441
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.350
And now actually the only thing left is to make

442
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.450
this look more appealing and actually like a window.

443
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.770
So first I'll just turn up the transmission all the way to one

444
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.270
and now we have to control the roughness.

445
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.670
No I just turn it down to zero

446
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.770
but we also have to create the gradient

447
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.060
they talked about earlier.

448
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.560
So let's now do that.

449
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.260
I want the gradient to be circular within each one of these quarters of the window.

450
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.860
So I'll simply use

451
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.310
another cornet node

452
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.860
and take the generated coordinates from that

453
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.460
two separate

454
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.260
each one of these quarters into one individual cell.

455
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.350
I'll just use a vector math notes. Set to multiply

456
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.350
And multiply the x. and the y component by two.

457
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.780
This conveniently also gives me the opportunity to eliminate the zet component

458
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.460
which I don't need because this is just a simple plain.

459
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.660
Then I just use the fraction operation

460
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.060
and there we go. Already separated the quarters in here.

461
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.170
Next I want to create a gradient from the center

462
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.670
So I just center the coordinates by subtracting 0.5 in the accident.

463
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.670
Why could our action

464
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.520
and then to create the actual gradient?

465
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.270
I want to use a trick that I showed you earlier as well

466
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.530
on this center to coordinate map.

467
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.850
I'll just use the absolute operation

468
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.020
that mirrors the positive value, some of the size for the accent,

469
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.960
the white component

470
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.130
and then

471
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.460
separate them

472
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.270
to combine them to a gradient

473
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.760
by using a smooth maximum operation without any smoothness.

474
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.300
This just gives me

475
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.450
this shape here.

476
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.960
But when I turn up the smoothest,

477
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.760
I can actually achieve some around corners here.

478
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.170
So if I plug this

479
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.460
into a colorado node,

480
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.060
I can nicely define this gradient here

481
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.460
and this still contains this

482
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.550
rectangular shape

483
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.670
without being completely circular.

484
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.960
So now let's use this gradient to create the roughness map.

485
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.270
I just use a map range note

486
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:24.670
And select the levels for the roughness to be something low like 0.03

487
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.360
in the center and let's just go all the way up to one on the edge.

488
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.060
But when I plug it in it still doesn't look quite as rough as I expected.

489
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.560
The problem is that this gradient does never really reach one

490
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.950
so we just have to

491
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.180
change around the scale of this

492
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.060
and there we go. This is a bit more like what I want to

493
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.050
these droplets however, on the opposite side of the window,

494
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.950
so I want the strength of the bump map

495
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.270
to decrease when the transmission is actually more rough

496
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.670
because there it gets less clear.

497
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.460
So it's again take this gradient

498
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.860
and then just inverted using a subtract note

499
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.760
so then I can just choose it as the strength of the bump map.

500
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.450
This makes it look a little bit better

501
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.770
by tuning down the effect and the wrath of values

502
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.670
and there we go. That is the shader. Pretty much done.

503
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.850
I just want to do one thing

504
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.860
which is

505
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.350
adding a scale node

506
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.170
to change the scale of the pattern

507
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:48.060
for the style I seen, I was going for some nice big stylized raindrops.

508
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.480
If you want to go for something more realistic,

509
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.170
of course you can go for a smaller scale

510
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.860
or more noise in the pattern

511
00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.860
or whatever you think is coherent with the reference you're looking at

512
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.200
but in terms of the work for example,

513
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.260
that is the procedural animated raindrops on the window done.
