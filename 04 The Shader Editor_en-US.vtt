00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.250
before I go over the basic functionality of the share editor.

1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.760
I want to quickly mention some things about the render engines

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.370
blenders owned to render engine cycles and EBI are designed to

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
be able to interpret the same material with a very similar result

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.220
however, because they work in a fundamentally different way,

5
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.210
some features are missing completely from one or the

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
other or have to be faked and look different.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.330
The most striking difference looking at the example seen is that

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.960
cycles allows for shader based displacement while Evie does not.

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.560
And this course cycles will be used as the target engine for rendering

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.650
and Evie will be used for immediate preview and real time interactivity.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
That is a very powerful workflow especially for

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.490
creating traders as you get immediate feedback while

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.020
you are changing values around which is something

14
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660
we will be doing a lot in this course

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.370
when you choose cycles as your engine in the render settings,

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.290
you can get the E V preview with a

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.850
neutral lighting environment by holding that and choosing material preview

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.660
and the cycles preview is in the rendered view.

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.060
This way you can comfortably work in

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.600
the material preview while rendering in cycles.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.440
So let's go over how to use the shader editor as

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.820
this is the environment that we will be working in.

23
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.510
I will be mentioning a lot of its functionality so you can get

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.450
the full picture but don't worry if you don't pick up everything immediately,

25
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.750
there will be plenty of opportunities to

26
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.860
get familiar with it throughout this course,

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.830
materials and blender are represented by no trees which

28
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.760
can be displayed and edited in the shadow editor

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.240
and no tree is a network of nodes where each note represents a fragment

30
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.960
of a shader that can be connected to other notes through inputs and outputs.

31
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.370
These connections carry information through the no

32
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.160
tree until it reaches a material output.

33
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.860
There are different types of information that is processed by the nodes.

34
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.060
The type provided by an output or required by an

35
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.860
input can easily be identified by the sockets color.

36
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.860
There are values gray colors, yellow vectors, blue and shader is green.

37
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.340
If you try to connect sockets with a different type,

38
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.150
blender will try to convert between the types

39
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.590
except for the shakers.

40
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.260
This conversion actually works back and forth between all types.

41
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.150
I will explain what these conversions mean. In the coming chapters,

42
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.120
you can add a note just like you can add anything else in blender

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.360
by pressing shift plus A and then choosing it from a selection of categories.

44
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.460
You can also use the search bar to find a specific note by name.

45
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.590
Also parallel to blenders.

46
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.970
Standard key map, you can duplicate notes by pressing shift plus D.

47
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.700
Connections are simply made by dragging them between

48
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.160
the sockets or selecting the notes and pressing F

49
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.690
to delete the connection.

50
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.210
You can just pluck it out of its socket and let go on an empty space or

51
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.430
you can cut the connection by holding down

52
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.660
control and dragging with the right mouse button pressed

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.600
to remove a note in between two notes without breaking the connection.

54
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.020
You can hold down alt and drag the note away.

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.330
In the same way you can drag a note onto

56
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.360
a connection and it will be inserted at that position.

57
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.170
When you drag with the left mouse button pressed,

58
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.260
you can use the tool that is selected in the toolbar

59
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.860
and that is usually the selection tool

60
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.660
by standard. It is set to box selection but you can choose any other method

61
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.600
to organize the nodes.

62
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.060
You can use the regular keys for transforming and blender, G R and S for grabbing,

63
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.560
rotating and scaling

64
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.090
Also A and also A for selecting and de selecting all nodes and X or Dell to the lead.

65
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.760
Work the same way as everywhere in blender.

66
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.580
If you want to delete a note while reconnecting the notes before and after.

67
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.360
You can simply delete it while holding down control

68
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.610
instead of deleting the note,

69
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.250
you can also temporarily disable or muted by pressing em

70
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.960
that will ignore it completely and pass through the

71
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.660
information like you can see from the red line

72
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.690
to make the no tree a bit more readable.

73
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.100
You can collapse or high notes by pressing age or even better hide unused

74
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.060
sockets by pressing control plus H to undo it just press it again.

75
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.810
Another very useful feature to keep the note

76
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.060
tree organized is setting a reroute note.

77
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.980
This is a simple pass through node that is just displayed as a single socket and can be

78
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.690
used to bundle multiple connections from the same socket

79
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.660
and structure the visual flow of the notary.

80
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.950
You can simply insert reroute notes by holding down shift

81
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.450
and dragging over a connection with the right mouse button pressed

82
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.760
to group together a segment of notes.

83
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.650
You can press control Plus G, which creates a note group.

84
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.050
This is a custom node which uses the external connections as inputs and outputs.

85
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.930
The main indicator that you are currently within

86
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.360
a note group is the green background.

87
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.360
You can enter a note group by pressing tab and exited by pressing control plus tab.

88
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.460
You can give you a note group a name by typing it into this text field here.

89
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.250
However, any single note can also be labeled in the properties window on the right.

90
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.560
The note group can be dissolved by pressing control plus out Plus G.

91
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.800
To only visually group notes.

92
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.660
You can create a frame and add the notes to it by dragging them inside

93
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.740
at this point I want to recommend you to enable the note Wrangler add on by

94
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.630
Greg cell which extends blender with a wide

95
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.850
variety of useful conveniences for an efficient noting workflow

96
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.760
it chips with blenders so you don't have to install anything Additionally,

97
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.150
you can simply activate it by going to the preferences under the adults tab

98
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.850
and searching for its name in the search bar.

99
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.660
I will be using it constantly throughout this course and cannot stress

100
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.850
enough how much time it saves to include it in your workflow.

101
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.460
Let's quickly go over some of its most useful features

102
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.460
by far the most essential functionality of the note Wrangler is the viewer Note.

103
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.790
When you hold down shift and control clicking on any

104
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.950
node will connect the material output to this node.

105
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.490
That enables you to preview any part of the notary

106
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.850
very easily and is essential for a good workflow.

107
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.210
If the note has multiple outputs repeatedly clicking on,

108
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.860
it will cycle through them.

109
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.050
Another very useful functionality is lazy connect

110
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.210
by simply holding down alt and dragging with the right mouse button pressed.

111
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.960
You can connect to nodes without carefully hitting the sockets with the cursor.

112
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.310
That feature will automatically try to connect

113
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.560
the right sockets by checking the type.

114
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.980
But if you want to connect specific sockets,

115
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.650
you can just instead hold down all plus shift while dragging between the

116
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.260
notes to get a menu of which output to connect to which input.

117
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.110
Other options that I use a lot are swapping out

118
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.190
a note for a different one with shift plus S,

119
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.600
which attempts to maintain the connection structure and using shift

120
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.060
plus P to create a frame around multiple notes,

121
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.750
which helps with the readability of the note tree.

122
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.740
These were the features that I personally use the most but

123
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.150
I recommend looking at the full feature overview on Greg's.

124
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.660
I'll that gets up Daddio forward slash note Wrangler.
